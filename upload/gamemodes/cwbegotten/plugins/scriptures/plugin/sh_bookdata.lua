<font color='#000' size='4'><b>A Misunderstood Legacy</b></font>

The Blagoona family began when a remarkable young Philimonjio man by the name of Blagoona Torquez ventured into the African continent across the sea. Blagoona Torquez began his reign of power after the establishment of the Holy Hierarchy in the African continent, and gave it the teachings of the Glaze. He began his worship with the Unenlightened Fucklets, those who lived in the East, but soon grew angry and distressed. The initial reasoning for this is yet unknown, but what is told in stories dating back to the beginning of Glaze and its formation, was that Torquez felt an immediate disconnection between his mind and the faith he was building upward.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Booby Blagoona - His faith, the people... and the beginning</b></font>

The Blagoona family was first recognized with Booby Blagoona in the last years of the First Era, a darkhided peasant from the far reaches of a Glazic discovery. What was unheard of by the Blagoona family, was that they were characters of great strength and ability. They looked for outreaches in their ways of guidance. They traveled very far and very boldly, and these characters of great ability, great mastery and great vigilance go on to tell their stories. These charismatic beings gave birth to a new age of reason and mindfulness among those they visited. These characters known as the Blagoonas came forth from an age of iron and steel, and threw themselves at the world for the world to see. There was no stopping Booby Blagoona, a man who rose to show the time of his age that he was up for the task of uniting, and so he did.

Booby himself rose from the times of chaos and destruction. The tribes from the Deadlands were in a conflict of civil war following their decimation at the hands of Lord Maximus. A time where they did not question otherwise why they would kill one another. Booby exposed to them a world unknown, and sought to unify these tribes folk.

Booby went from a child to a grown man with the hairs under the arms. He was a tall giant with a humble personality, but a nasty side of him that scorched the world. Not only that, but Booby Blagoona was a lot different from his forefather, the Torquez. He was no longer of Philimonjio blood, with an intact brain and heart that effortlessly visualized a victory over those who would jeopardize the alliance of the tribes. 

Much like others around him, he grew up where poverty was the only thing he knew. It was at one point as Blagoona grew old and as time went, that he wanted more out of his life, and so he grew from a small branch on the plant of solitude, to a man very talkative in nature and profound in speech. And what he did to further his education was read the relics of what was left behind after the embarkation of the African Continent many years ago in the First Era. He read on and on. It was said by many that it would be days before anyone would realize Booby was gone from his home in the community. He would sit by the river outside of society and soak in the information of literary mastery. Quitting was no longer part of Blagoona, so he continued and persevered to understand what these literary pieces meant to him.. He wanted to decipher what it all meant, and indeed he did.

Book_Booby_Page3 = [[
It was a warm August morning when Blagoona made farewells to his people of inner Humanity. Family, friends, all alike were given the farewells of compassion and sympathy from him. He knew he had to move on with life, and so he did... very soon actually. It was only that evening on the same day that he departed for the greatness he always wanted, a new experience in life in the next journey he would come to. 

The next morning it was documented that his village was savagely destroyed by a nearby rival tribe... Booby would discover the abandonment of his home village many years after in the tale of his return to the African continent. Those who lived with him were either killed or enslaved and he would want revenge for it all. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>A Tale of Beauty Inside</b></font>

The tale goes that as the grand poet Booby Blagoona stepped onto the pedestal and gave forth his first speech, many years later, all eyes glistened and focused on the master at his finest. It was only then that everybody in the crowd felt his inner beauty, his majestic nature, his intelligence. The stars sparkled under the night of a man soaked in the passions of speech. He gave forth the words later deciphered by Hard-Glaze translators and literary geniuses associated. These words go as following:

<i>"I want the world to know, the peasants and darkhides, keep fighting, but know what you are fighting for in this world. I want you all to understand the embodiment of a man. It is I, Blagoona. Do not stop fighting may I say, but do know what you are fighting for in this world. Understand, comprehend the wars that go on in this world. As I firmly place my hand on my chest, and read out the scriptures, I want all to twinkle with vitality."</i>
-The Great Booby Blagoona, as he speaks with robustness on behalf of a 240,000 person parade in the Capital of Glaze itself and spectators of greater numbers. Lord Maximus tunes in on this gathering, watching from above in his bedroom window in envy.
]]

Book_Booby_Page4 = [[
An uproar of Powderboys and Guardians scrambled to their feet and began a displacement in the capital's parade. It is said that during this change in behavior, noblemen and peasants together within the walls of the Capitol had gained a huge surge of rebellion in their hearts from Blagoona's speech, and had sent the entire city on a full lockdown status alert. Every door in the Garden of Glaze is put on full lock-down. Soldiers were struggling to stop the rioting as the city went into a full-fledged outbreak. Infrastructure destroyed, burnt to the ground. Even the royal escort vehicle was flipped upside down in the road and torched to a crisp by the rioters. All of this commotion only got worse when the Royal Palace was surrounded by a lynch mob of angry protesters, all wanting to kill Lord Maximus.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Esteemed Writer and Visionary</b></font>

Boxer Harvus Krammy (b. 3E d. 4E), was a Hard-Glazed author, humorist, philosopher, researcher, and Royal Senator. He is universally acclaimed for his works, including the world-famous The Perpetual Urges and its lost-to-time sequel, The Persistent Urges. Krammy, in his younger years as a Hard-Glazed researcher, contributed to the immensely valued and important research document, The Manifesto, which forever changed the way that the Phillimonjios viewed the Hard-Glazed system, as well as The Festering Bypass.

Though Krammy at the height of his career was among the richest men in all of the world, it soon came crashing down. Indeed, throughout his life Krammy was plagued by never-ending scandals. However, regardless of this, he was a man highly respected by those in the Royal Senate, including his enemies. Even Lord Maximus himself held Krammy as a dear friend. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Early Life</b></font>

Not much is known of Krammy's early life, other than that he attended university District 1 and that his name appeared in many essays and research documents dating from the early years of the Third Era. It would appear that he was an esteemed researcher of the human mind, but soon decided to take up penmanship, writing many short stories and novels deeply rooted in Hard-Glazed culture.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Political Career and Fateful Duel</b></font>

Beginning in the last year of the Third Era, Krammy was suddenly instated by the Lord's decree to the office of Advisor to the Royal Senate. This appointment was a prestigious one, bringing with it the benefits and respect of noble life. However, it was revealed by an investigation shortly after Krammy's death that Krammy, despite his unusual rising within the upper echelons of Hard-Glazed society, had always despised the Royal Senate. Fragments from his diary state that Krammy thought the Royal Senate "prioritized morality" when it came to the lesser gene pool.

Indeed, during the turbulent times in the early years of the Fourth Era, the Royal Senate passed legislation that forbade the masters from striking their slaves for disobedience.

It is hotly debated to this day on whether or not this act was passed because the Royal Senate sympathized with the plight of their fellow man, or if they believed that the beatings hampered how much they could produce. Krammy also believed that the Royal Senate were "incompetent fools", and "corrupt as a man’s mind after the sight of a lady". Krammy's suspicions were proven correct after the collapse of the Royal Senate, but Krammy never lived to see their punishment.

As Senatorial Advisor, Krammy had access to the entirety of the Royal Senate, and was present during all decision-making. He used his position to accomplish two main goals: undermining the Royal Senate and advancing his political career. His second goal was fulfilled when Krammy was appointed as an official Royal Senator upon the death of the leader of the National Faith Party. Krammy often obtained evidence of corruption from within the ranks of the Royal Senate, and then used this evidence to blackmail corrupt senators into doing his bidding. This made Krammy many enemies in the Royal Senate, and among them was the leader of the Royal Aristocratic Party, Thomas Edwards. The rivalry only worsened when Krammy was elected as leader of the National Faith Party, which was the most powerful party in the Royal Senate.
]]

Book_Boxer_Page3 = [[
Edwards' opposition to Krammy's ambitions eventually lead to a fierce rivalry between the two, where both men would openly denounce each other on the Royal Senate floor to the respective applause of their supporting parties and jeering by the other. Eventually, their rivalry would culminate in a famous duel in which both Edwards and Krammy were nearly killed. This incident left both of them recovering for months, and so both major political parties in the Royal Senate were without their leaders. Consequently, this left Krammy blameless for the Royal Senate's involvement in the emancipation scandal, a defining moment in Hard-Glazed history which separates the Third Era from the Fourth Era. However, some speculate that Krammy may have sown the seeds for the scandal in the first place, attempting to destroy the Royal Senate from within.

As a direct result of the Royal Senate's involvement, Lord Maximus crippled the power of the Royal Senate for good, including the dismissal of every Royal Senator and the establishment of the Small Council, with only a few of Lord Maximus’ most trusted advisors remaining within the senate authority. Krammy, now powerless and without a source of income, returned to authorship.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>The Perpetual Urges and Controversy</b></font>

Even as Krammy took up the mantle of Advisor to the Royal Senate, a laborious and strenuous job, he still continued to work on novels and stories for the masses. However, he was forced to abandon his pursuits in writing upon becoming an official Royal Senator, returning after being dismissed by Lord Maximus.

After the passing of the Fourth Erotica Ban (22) by the new Royal Senate, Krammy had decided that he'd "had enough with the Royal Senate's games". He sought to inspire the masses to revolt against the oligarchy and install a new senate in its place. It was during his time of peak suspicion and hatred of the Royal Senate that he completed his greatest masterpiece, The Perpetual Urges. It quickly became a bestseller, and is widely regarded to be the single most impactful work in all of Hard-Glazed history. Because of the success of The Perpetual Urges, Boxer H. Krammy became a household name. Yet, the vast audiences who had read Krammy's work had ignored the deeper message within, and Krammy soon found himself frustrated that the Royal Senate was still in power.

At the same time, many of the more conservative in the population were offended by the vulgarity and radical new concepts that it proposed. The Royal Senate knew that something had to be done about Krammy, and so began a master plan which would eventually lead to Krammy's fall from grace.
]]

Book_Boxer_Page5 = [[
<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Later Life and Execution</b></font>

The Royal Senate, joined by the obedient Small Council, chastised Krammy in the middle Fourth Era, citing the fact that The Perpetual Urges was a likely bypass to the Fourth Erotica Ban (22). Times were becoming more turbulent due to the rapid industrialization, and worker unrest was rising. The political and social backlash was immediate. Krammy was stripped of all honorary titles and his accounts were frozen. All of his works and originals were confiscated, though for some unknown reason his published works remained unbanned and available to the general public. Krammy retired to a log cabin deep in the outskirts of District 3. During this time he wrote poetry about the depressing smokestacks of the encroaching factories as more were built across the County Districts, and began work on a sequel to The Perpetual Urges, called The Persistent Urges. However, as his next great work was nearing completion, the Royal Senate took further action to impede Krammy. One night, while Krammy was visiting District 1 to recite poetry for Lord Maximus himself, unknown assailants burnt Krammy's cabin to the ground. Lost were many historical artifacts of utmost importance, as Krammy was a collector of antiquities. Some of the artifacts lost included items from the Old World, pre-dating the First Era. Additionally, while Krammy was in District 1, the Royal Senate stealthily organized riots against Krammy and The Perpetual Urges. In face of mass social unrest and a possible collapse of society, Lord Maximus had Krammy condemned to die by spooning. 

His last words were reportedly:
<i>"Once, I superfluously gave spokesmen like myself the rant of a lifetime. I will not let these boisterous baboons intrude on my work. Maybe because I'm kind hearted, but not for now will that happen in the eyes of the very Senate. We must ally with these fucklets, if we are to make way."</i>

The true meaning of these words remains unclear.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>County Districts</b></font>

The 'County Districts' refer to the Glaze-owned territories along the border separating the Glaze and the Gore. These districts are typically of lower quality and are the only districts under control of the Ministers, and not the Small Council. Many consider these districts to not actually be part of the Hard-Glazed system, and are rather independent villages owned by peasants. 

Among the population of the County Districts include the retard, the darkhide, the savage, the pagan, the poor, the hungry, the fucked, the unenlightened, and the rejected of Philimonjio ancestry. For this, they are barred from the Central Districts and relegated to fucked living conditions hilariously out-matched by the pure perfection of the Central Districts.

Despite this, they remain of high population. Some Glazic scholars assume this is because of their high production efforts, with most factories and menial work relegated to the County Districts’ peasant population.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Discovery of the Gore</b></font>

Dating back to the dawn of the First Era, the ‘Gay Gores’ started off in a shroud of mystery. Originally thought to be a mad cult of northern folk, the Glazic nobility paid them little attention. Early serfs would report to their local Minister about 'mad mountain-men and spearfolk, white of skin' who would watch their villages at a distance. Rumors would spread among the County Districts which bordered between the Gore and Glaze.

It was not until the Second Era, in the aftermath of the Hierarchy wars, that the Royal Senate heard word of the Goreic Kingdom. It was said that a local county district's tradition was to send their village elders to the north, so that they would become one with the snow. For years they would send their elders into the cold winds of the north, and none would return. This changed when an elder returned from their quest with a 'ghastly look,' and a word of their findings in the Northlands. His findings were immediately reported to the Royal Senate, detailing a face-to-face meeting with these men, who called themselves 'the Gores' and spoke of false gods that were of anti-Glazic intent.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Goreic Kingdoms</b></font>

<i>"I suppose It'd be quite requisitory of the Royal Senate to enact a burdening response to these recent attacks on our peasant friends. To sit back, wait, and hope for a digression? Simply put, these Spearfolk must be swiftly cut down before they grow in number."</i>
—V.K Heimann - the 'Steel Tongue' of his days.

Around the late phase of the Second Era, beginning with the first encounter of the Gores at the Gay King Summit, Goreic raids have grown from legendary to quite common and then annoyingly frequent. From ambassador intelligence to captured Spearfolk, it was apparent that a great number of Goreic men were actually once of Glazic faith, and have converted over. Life among these people is extremely simple, their day consisting of crawling around in dark underground tunnels, or in cold villages on the mountains. Strangely, when asked what these men believe in, each response will vary. 

According to the beliefs of the Gores, a great set of deities rule over the world, known as the 'Family.' This family, consisting of two brothers, a sister, a mother, and a father, had created the world by 'finding the way.' The names of these deities never seem to be agreed on, but their roles seem unanimously known. The mother is the caretaker, the voice of reason. The father is the hunter, the seeker of nourishment for the family, but without the other members of the family to support him, he is nothing. The first brother is intelligent, but lacks communion. The second brother is of great communion, but lacks intelligence. The sister is the trickster, who causes troubles for the family, but will also help the family in time of need.

There is no noble class of these Gore people, but only a single faith system that guides them all. A series of schisms along the county districts have called for various purges to occur, but for every dead Gore another rises to take their place. Goreic activities have become widespread knowledge after the late Goreic Purges called by Minister Willtan that resulted in an absolute suppression of the Spearfolk militia. Despite our victories, it will indeed be a great struggle before these beast-men are completely removed from the light of Sol.

It was April 23rd, when two political heros and serious competitors of Goreic ancestry were prepared for quick execution, inside a primitive village isolation. Each perpetrator responsible for the genocide of an entire Glazic mining community. It was up to Millar to clean the residue left over after all campaigns in the northern Goreic-Glaze regions.

<i>"They rose from the ashes of a terrible conflict and gave hope to the nation, but that was only the beginning..."</i> 
-Charles Simmons, Drill Sergeant under command of Gen. Millar C. Prance. Second man to witness the first encounter. April 23rd, I. Holy Hierarchy Wars. 

There is no dispute in the empire that is powerful enough to reign hell on rayless beings of charcoal, a true land of gold, house of cultural diversity even when fucklets are crust, shit, or simply both. As always, the diversity allows for the fowls of evil to be admitted their blessings from The Glaze. It was the Gay Kings Men however, that stuttered the speech of noble spokesmen. Sabre clung men, the hardest of foul-mouthed raiders, to kill for coin. Soothe blanketed soldiers pledging an oath to unfair tactics. 

Even those Glazic souls, shortly trained and seasoned in the art of powder, had no bicker with such mystified ones. And a thick-skinned highness that held the imperial purse and emblematic family trophies, all in duel and humorless play in the fields; no match were any of these positions of those brandishing purity to the end of their days, which the Glaze would deem. 

As these homos of strangeness continued their discussed odyssey from uncharted estates, plagued by the Holy Hierarchy conflicts. Once places already of unconventional government and oddball customs, it was a no-brainer to many, that these mystified beings would come from the nuisances of the world, and challenge a superpower of the world.

They looked to find refuge, worse in a triumphant nation at best, but who is to say the coin is not turned to reveal the Glazic people and their looking for salvation. Only one would hope not, for the Glaze is all they knew, and hopes to only know when darkness shrouded the world, as history tends to repeat itself.

The strangers received zero backlash, as the country itself was hanging on the balance, with a war in the closing, and the leftover destruction unimaginable. So when these interesting beings arrived, making their first appearances in autonomous regions bordering Goeric mountains, it was no wonder that all banded together and greeted these fascinating ones. Those who would seem to magically morph from thin air into the many neighboring treelines, walking endlessly from wherever they came from through enormous plains.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Immortal Awakenings (A Child Abduction)</b></font>

A terrible scheme of backstabbing had surfaced after six months from when the powerful beings was discovered, in one of outlying Goeric-Glaze autonomous regions, known for the first sightings of travelers by the Hard-Glaze commander. The story so goes, that a young boy onwards to becoming an apprentice hunter, only at the time coming of age, had traveled with his grand father deep into the forests almost bordering the mysterious Goeric lands. This boy was innocent, and never thought much of what he was doing. He was going by what his grand father had instructed him to do, both of them originally together on a pleasant hunting trip. It was until the boy was specifically told by the wiser man to go fetch five items of the land, that something had happened. It was told in order as is. 

"Child do as I say.. recite the words three times after me. I acquire these five things." 
And so the child listened attentively, eyes wide awake. 
"One Portobello Mushroom from the largest of ancestors oak tree." 
"One picking of Microsorum Pteropus, three leaves each." 
"One Dryopteris Filix-Mas, one single leaf." 
"One slice of wet bark from last nights sprinkle, found on a oak tree of our ancestors." 
"And finally one handful of the purest red berries, careful not to be poisonous." 

The boys grand father told the boy to open his hand, where the man gently placed a cold dagger in, and slowly had the boy close his clutch around it protectively. He also put his very own leather satchel on the boys frail body, over his small shoulders, and kissed the boy on his forehead before sending him on his way. 

As the boy marched hesitantly into uncharted territory that became increasingly dark and moist, the elder shouted through the trees for him:
]]

Book_Gay_Page5 = [[
"Child, remember the five things I require, and return for supper and you will make me a happy man. I have faith in you!" 

The boy yelled "Yes pappa!" before continuing onwards into the void. 

It was two hours into the wilderness that the boy had found himself confused and lost, unable to retrace his steps as told times before, and the little one finally had found himself slumped up against a tree with none of the five things anywhere in sight. The boy felt himself falling asleep, exhausted from the long voyage, and had awakened to the sounds of night owls, crickets, and russling in the nearby bushes. He had lost track of time and clearly disobeyed his elders instruction to return at supper. 

As the boy gathered himself and prepared to try and find his way back home, he couldn't help but notice out of the corner of his eye, a white glimmer that stood out in the darkness, strangely grabbing the younglings attention. 

The boy decided to follow the glimmering orb in the world without light, and it had felt like an endless tunnel he walked through, each step growing the orb larger and larger. The boy continued towards the orb until the glimmer had suddenly shifted into a dramatic beam that shot out in his face like a sword, blinding the child enough for him to have to squint hard. 

Gradually as the light engulfed the childs entire perspective, his vision recovered as well, allowing him to witness a world that appeared to mimic a place that put the greatest Hard-Glaze wonders to shame. Those being artificial and nothing more, and this seeming more real than anything ever witnessed. 
]]

Book_Gay_Page6 = [[
In the boys underdeveloped mind, he had perceived this incredible sight as the Light itself, but was still unsure what it actually was. The belief of it being The Light however, was remarkably a reasonably agreed concept embedded in Hard-Glaze society at the time.

The child, at that moment, thought what he was witnessing was some strange fever that triggered an onset hallucination, perhaps from a form of poison ivy he sat in when falling asleep in the forest. But there was no evidence of iritation or markings on his skin, checking himself furiously. It was a strange phenomenon the boy could not explain, and as happening he felt more compelled to discover what it could all mean. 

Time had seemed to cease, as the brightness toned easier on the eyes, allowing for the little one to see the captivating dreamscape. It was the recognisable Capitol District and the typical outskirts, but suddenly the powerful light emerged again for a brief minute, before fading one final time. 

At this point a thick haze had taken the place of the overwhelming light, directly overlapping the cityscape that was seen only moments ago. The Capitol District’s current design then transformed after leftover haze into something only envisioned by the greatest intellectuals Lord Maximus could muster up in society. The city now standing as a miraculous showpiece beyond any one persons comprehension, a positive vision of the future. 

All of society had shifted into the brightest future in the blink of the kids eyes, in a state that presented itself best described as silver and gold surfacings everywhere the iris could saturate. A rich society that allowed elegance without baggage. The infrastructure notorious, with colossal skyscapers, towering over streets and overpasses, all materialized into very intelligible design to show a still triumphant society, this time revived to its former glory. Other things were witnessed afar.

Objects, very sophisticated in design, somehow suspended miles in the air. These were the first spaceships, sharing the skies with other vehicles, before the erupting with powerful boosters that put the fastest stallions to shame. Beams of energy shooting directly in the air, many of these energy pockets situated all over the place, any areas one could not even conceivably think, across the skyline forming colorful spires through the clouds piercing the atmosphere above. 

The land was fresh and cleansed of chemicals and pollutions left after a terrible war. A land showered sweet from sorrow and chaos that plagued the people of its time. It was the most beautiful thing one person could witness, and a simpleton kid who found it through a light, had been stunted, frozen in his place completely, absorbing everything at once. 

The child watched as little ants moved across the skyline, the land timelapsing into morning, evening, night, and repeat.. People in their daily lives. Society in motion, as the beauty seemed to continue endlessly like a simulation, the shining imagery then began to quickly dim into darkness, and the eyes of the child shielded once again.. he blinked, realizing what now was in front of him. Something wasn't right here at all. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>The Mass Mobilization (The Rising)</b></font>

After five back to back days of fear and anguish in the local community the boy resided in, the regional governor had received word of the tragedy, and under the pressures of the entire populace the man delivered a notion of action. He spited every fucker peasant deterring him from finishing a mediocre meat platter that tasted as dry as disgusting old peasant nibble.

Book_Gay_Page8 = [[
But in his eyes the best thing yet. This royal pig fake having never visited the Capitol District at all. With all of the governments coffers for a piss-poor autonomous region in bankruptcy, this unsavory man had an angry fit from being kept from finishing his plate. But it was before coming to his senses about the rumored lost child, that he quickly made a change in heart and stamped the official paperwork with a red seal, and that a search party was legally underway.

So as required, a semi-efficient militia troop was assembled from the barracks, but it was the slowest most undisciplined fighting force, many of these men a coarse type, but admired for their rugged backgrounds of toughness at least. However these men were corrupt type at large, and seen as uncivilized and a world apart from the nobles residing outside of these counties. The troop itself was also struggling, but at least they had weapons to use.

The marksmen brandished longbows with limited arrows, and the rest of the troop carried variations of spears and the dullest warblades decades old, and only a select few actually held onto a somewhat impressive gunpowder piece passed down from unimpressive legacy holders. It was the most this fighting force could build up, as the outlying counties were hit the hardest in the wake of Holy Hierarchy Wars, where all resources had suddenly vanished. 

The two men identified carrying such guns was the Governor himself, having noone reliable and trustworthy enough to command a fighting force in the fields. At his side nothing more than an ignorant, blatantly clueless weakling. His very own stepson. The imbecile thought once as being retarded. The governor was like many county rulers at the time however, trapped in poverty and accustomed to dirty work that placed him almost on a level to his own serfs. But it was his stupid stepson given the powers to inherit the pathetic bankruptcy incase death struck swift, because honestly who cared.

So the army was mobilizing with what dwindling troops it could encourage, and a few somewhat decent officers were told to sprint to nearby townships and villages and knock on every door to a home, and stir the pot. Efforts to claim additional numbers to find the boy were met with resistance, and these dimwitted officers were being inefficient in everything they did, not to even say professional in the slightest. 

It was dark already, and people settling inside for the night were awakened by the loudest knocking and shouting of orders. As clear as the moon, this was no ordinary search party it seemed, as a child going missing was something people never thought would happen in communities where lessons were taught the hard way, and Goeric-Glaze ideas intermingled and gave false impressions to keep children from being naughty, or stupid in the forests adults would not go. 

As the news of a search party continued, the ragtag soldiers flashed a small artists interpretation of the boy, the shittiest inaccurate picture from the Governors worst painter. These pictures were shoved aggressively in peoples faces, and if unable to answer the simplest question of who this boy was, the scumbags in power would chop open throats/loot bread/move to the next. Everybody around the small region knew what the kid looked like however, given these were small family communities where people knew if the Governor was sleeping around with several of the villagers wives, when the husbands were working hard in the mines all day. 

The entire village square was trashed and littered, with enraged villagers storming back to their homes to gather up the weapons. Women and children seeked shelter, and only the faintest of heart in these categories decided to follow the masses. It was witnessed that the mothers would drag their crying infants by their arms to safety, but the fathers being so crazed would knock around everywhere, like drunkards and step over the fallen younglings. Others were summoned to watch.

The commutal center was lit like an inferno of fire, but the rest of the streets and areas were pitchblack. Quickly more and more villagers assembled with pitchforks and farm equipment, all bluntforce objects it seemed, and those who questioned such overreacting peoples were put on a blacklist for later wrist slashing. All of the wisest elders were forced into the commutal gathering, and told to present clues into the whole mess. It was until the oldest of the elders had spoke out and silenced the entire rabble, that everybody stormed out of the gates with their lanterns and their murdering tools. 

"It's the fucking ol' dark hide that kidnapped that poor child! The only one who lives here!" 

The lynchmob fought through the gates, and smaller search parties were starting to construct once outside. The Governor had only then arrived to witnessed what he had intentionally started earlier, ontop of a black steed with metal plates covering its eyes, armed to the teeth.

Travel gear mixed in with military grade hardware, all the necessary killing parts like spare swords and lengths of rope for hanging fucklets, bundled up into pockets hanging from the side of the horse. But all of the war parts seemed mundane in comparison to the decapitated head of a Goeric criminal, skewered ferociously on a mount sitting above the saddle like a flag.

The more agile boys able to weld a weapon were sent out to light bonfires in random places across the dark field opening, and as these fires lit ablaze massively, they started to attract more and more people across the lands. These were beacons of an emergency. The devoutly religious and fanatic would serve the Governor and fuel his cause, and end up traveling oceans of geography to finally organize along with the others. This whole commotion was no ordinary lynchmob assembling, but a historic milestone, and there would be an endless surplus of warm bodies in for sweet revenge. 

The fire piles were gigantic, and were only said to have been used once in a blue moon. As burning fuels smokestacked the starry night, strange foreign noises would erupt over all the chaotic people every several minutes. These being indicators that a new party had just arrived. Each horn had a distinct echo that represented the Goeric family and tradition. The new arrivals would start off as a small group, but it would end up being atleast thirty minutes or more, before an estimated five hundred bloodthirsty motherfuckers had marched out into the grassy plain opening to greet the governor. 

Eye witnesses reported that the governor exchanged handshakes and Goeric prayers, before opening a pouch and dropping precious gems in each leaders hands.

"It was all so strange to see a Glaze-Born elite issuing pleasantries to a widely misunderstood peoples, and both societies cooperating in the midst of a crisis." 
"Our Glazic Union carried the weight of fifty lifetimes of bloodshed on the Goeric peoples, and yet these gifts had charmed such selfish brutal peoples." 
-Elmer Roskimer, Glazic minuteman of the militias 41st Sword & Slingers, and eye witness account during the arrival of Goeric Warbands from the north. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>A Goeric-Glaze Dispute</b></font>

The Goeric re-enforcements had arrived at request, and the governor had gold coins in his eyes. He dismounted to salute the toughest Gore chieftains he could find in the outback, and these warriors stood still with unreadable expressions, as they expected something "more serious." These warriors looked as if they were living in caves for a milinium. Giant muscular males with the longest unkempt beards ever seen. 

These guys put the governors toughest militia to pity, and the meatiest man alive in rank stepped aside as the Goerics entered the governor's caravan. It was all a true sign of an overreaction on the Governor’s part, and now he had to pay the price for it. Over a fucking child lost. 

All Gore regulars carried the similar, but it was the three distinct big guys that held the prize. These commanders known for nasty guerilla tactics had salvaged armor likely from corpsed army generals of the past. They carried a combination of priced artifacts passed down from warchief to warchief, all stemming old Goeric-Glaze conflicts that raged their homelands, and yet they were speaking with a considered enemy.

The governor had no quarrel with these men, they'd rip his fucking face off in a heartbeat. So he bowed servitude to THEM, and kneeled very presentable infront with one foot supported like a jester. Somewhat ashamed about all of this, and feeling he was embarassing his army, he cracked a sarcastic smile as if it was all some kind of joke. Typical enough, these Goeric generals had seen it all, and were unphased by his pathetic princess gesture, and some failed to even notice the bow. Now they only looked at the idiocy going on around them. 

The governor stood up, and the biggest of all Gore chieftains made a grumbling sound with his mouth, chomping on a straw of hay and looking ahead like deep in thought. His name was Glaymore Bumbostomp, and his title gave light on what he loved doing - stomping skulls to cheddar. Bumbostomp finally crossed eyes with the now profusely sweating Glaze governor, and started to reach into his very own personal bag. From there he very intentionally pulled out a very large object from the flap, as slow as humanly possible. Stomp had to place it on both hands at once, it being that heavy, and when the Governor finally understood, all he could do was cry. 
<font color='#222' size='12'><b><i>"Spite the fools!"</i></b></font>
- The words of famous governor Alexander Pantis, as he urged his bodyguards to attack the Goeric giants.

It was a destroyed skull, only parts of the jaw still remaining, and Bumbostomp was unsatisfactory about the gem tributes given to him and his other friends. He wanted something else, and it was annexation of the township, the full region, and all neighboring farms and assets available. He also ordered for the governor to give up rights to the castle estate already falling into disrepair.

Book_Gay_Page14 = [[
If unable to comply, the Goreic hordes would besiege the township and torch every living and non living thing, and plague the land with an immersurable quantity of illnesses, aswell as make the governors domain a hotspot for fielding armies to penetrate Hard Glaze soil. Essentially Bumblestomp was a visionary, and wanted to obtain ownership. Bumbostomp also promised that all surviving peoples of the land would be converted to the Goeric belief system, and promised a surplus of partners and riches in return. 

Right away the chaos had tripled and the governors bodyguards ran to his aid, unsheathing fancy swords. The governor begged the Gores with one fundemental question, as dozens of his security forces jumped into position to attack.

"Why is THIS land of value to you, kind sir?" 

Bumblestomps size made the governor pathetic, and Bumble motioned for a henchman to slowly lay down an antique suitcase. First the Gore held up a hand in the most lethargic way, and the bodyguards all reacted quickly to the motion, running backwards an estimated seven feet. The three giants not moving a muscle. The governmental security however, acting like loyal mutts, soon enclosed again with persistence. "Open it, fool." hollered Bumble, and the Glazeman made a whimpering sound that some of his men grimaced to.

The governor continued the follow none the less, and cautiously lifted up the lid. A person popped out fast wearing a brightly striped colored jumpsuit and cone hat -- Bumbles dwarf son, now laughing in a high pitched schizoid voice. One or two of the governors armed henchmen threw up their buckler shields tighter, as the little fuck appeared out of the small space. Just when things couldn't get worse, the governor's timid state was overthrown by a sensation of pure hatred and disgust. Right in the heat of the moment, he inched forward closest to the ugly ass midget, until he could see a nasty infected bump on its bottom lip. 

Spectators reported that the governor threw the hardest suckerpunch imaginable in the little shit’s face. The midget fell backwards in a bloody mess, bringing with him the suitcase, but the tiny jokester continued to laugh hysterically with a broken nose, squirming around like a worm. The midget and the suitcase collided with Bumblestom’s legs, and everything at that moment busted out of control. People started dying at an alarming rate. 

"The guards were using gentlemens fairness the first matter of seconds, but as men looked around at their best friends being lifted in the air and chucked, these troopers came to their senses, realizing they would not win this fight like that.." 

The three huge Gores having no time to waste, started plowing into everything without warning. The governor slipped away and screamed a deafening three words: 

"Spite the fools!"

His shieldbearers created a sloppy testudo wall to cover him, while men from each wing did hit and run maneuvers. The giant fuckheads started ripping through the caravans wagons and supplies. Men were being thrown ridiculously high like ragdolls, and the very best Glaze Guards were butchered most violently until unrecognisable. Not a single Gore harmed, because these were the spoils of war, and the Gores knew it. So they continued to trash every element until blood ran deep in the lands heritage. The Governor managed to slip away untouched, but all of his best troops had been torn apart, limb from limb like the dumbest creatures. These Gores were known for inhumane treatment, and did not give the men a fighting chance. 

"Men are running in all directions, dropping their arms and fleeing. Some have discharged their powder shots but the balls are flying into a forest. I'm seeing advances two-fold. The enemy is advancing two-fold, and the Governor's convoy has been demolished. The township is under attack, and our allies have deserted us."

The township was seen for miles over pinetrees, engulfed in a maroon smoke. The governor managing to escape the undergoing mayhem, had barely outrun Goeric pursuers on foot to a nearby horse stable. There, he rode the last remaining steed to his fortified castle estate. 

The army was in shambles, men dragging their fallen peoples across the battlefield. Some made it outside the boundary, but found themselves being attacked by bandits. 

As the district leader galloped to the crossroads of a once blossoming fishing commute, he had witnessed uninterrupted evil. The despairs of great peoples known for heroism, triumph over evil, perseverance, and the continuity of nobility -- A bloodline preserved for generations, and traced back to the even the first settlers. Now it was all gone, and this man was the reason for it. A stupid lord who inherited too much. 

He was the audience of such evils, nobody cared at all.

When returning days later, he was struck immensely. An almost surreal sight. Religious centers had been long since blackened by fires that occured. Chapels, safe havens for everybody, used for sadistic killings. Manufacturing districts exploded from the inside out, all workers of these operations incinerated in seconds.
 
Departing from the ghostly place, he became aware of the Gay Gore, and how they stomped the seat of power. The magistrate had windows busted out, and gunpowder residue: the proof of what happened. Tiny holes, at least fifty or more, had penetrated the front doors like a cheese grater . These motherfuckers used grapeshot on the Mayor. 

It was pouring down now and the lord's tears were hidden through the rain. He could not sustain, all emotion almost drained, making him colder and more vengeful. 

Why? Why were these spoils of war allowed? Did these Gores have no discipline? Why did they do this? It was too late to wonder, action was now needed. 

The Gores were unshy of letting corpsed fucklets marinate the slop dirt. The highness had to ride over a barricade of bodies in a military checkpoint. Loads of impaled suckers too, to rot wastefully in the weather. 

When riding out of the dead commute he had discovered masses of the peasants, marching their own little make-believe armies out of the town. 

"Ahh, so the dark hide is working evils with the Gore...." 

These were the peasant infidels deemed forever imprisonment. Now these workers waved a Goeric flag that was modified for a false idol! So the man atop his horse looked a gaze like daggers, scrutinizing these whoresons in motion.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>A Bitter Rival</b></font>

He was greeted by hundreds of surviving men congregating outside a swampy moat. The drawbridge was lifted up to keep their own men from entering the facility. It was only an hour and a half into the battle and men were retreating to their last line of defense. Troopers were heard in agony, doctors hastily working in tents to patch up the wounded, and those unable to be saved quickly shoved into makeshift graves that dug up the outer perimeter. Some were thrown in large craters with dozens of others on top, a mixture of dead and alive, many assumed already gone. Upon seeing the governor arrive on horseback, many of these defeated men gave an exhausted cheer. The lord bestowing a tired gesture himself, and numerous souls continued working at a snails pace with shovels. There were plenty of dead sons to bury in the earth. 

It was dark and the governor shouted from below for the defiant sentries to drop the bridge. Finally they complied, only after the governor ordered his men to begin torching his stronghold. The governor had little energy left.

The revolting serfs had now just returned, armed with the blacksmiths creations, and the blacksmith himself tied in a sack. Men were still trying to get inside, being showered left and right by arrows and rocks. They put almost no effort to get in, men falling off the sides of the bridge into the murky depths and drowning. The ocassional powder shot was fired from the mob, missing, but it was loud enough to demoralize. 

Many souls lives were now in the hands of peasantry, as the rebelling serfs were making great strides, the lord having no choice but to leave family to die. As the drawbridge struggled to be raised, the last thing heard was the voice of a soldier, almost inside but crippled. He was only a boy.

"Put the boy down so he may live a better life!" 

People argued what to do, some of the relatives panicking to try and save the kid from dying. Knights lined up to push them back, before the lord had enough and screamed for captain to play the bugle. More were called to help.

A line of pikemen formed at the entrance to slow the advancement, a priest now giving the blessing fast. The mother with her back turned, sobbing. Women were also shielding their younglings from seeing the horrors, the father of the boy the only relative allowed to watch. He clutched his hands like fists, a straight face the entire time. His father knew his child would die, so the man was strong. Silent as he looked his boy in the eyes. 

"Lest us remember you, champion! And lest us remember Hard-Glaze. The divine shall lift you...." 

The remaining observed as the pikes pulled back, and the gates came crashing down. The father of the boy continued to look at his dying son until he could not. Suddenly there was the sound of a crossbow bolt released, and a gurgling sound replacing horrifying shrieks. The father was relieved of all worry, shutting his eyes. The final siege had only just begun.

Governor Pantis had no objection for a well planned last standing, so he ordered the big boys to kill all reserves from inside with hands, knowing it could falter the advance of a siege for several more days, and keep good blades from becoming bad blades. These defenses would hold good, but starvation was a concern, even for inexperienced powerholders. So Pantis demanded something seeming foolish at first, but in his eyes a fury vengeance to wreck sick humanity. 

Two scouts were dismissed from tedious labor inside the fortress, to perform more tedious labor outside the fortress. It was when these two men with speed had acquired more than a scenic overview of corpsed fucklets scattered in outlying ruins, that they ran a even harder one back to inform Pantis of a new upcoming razing. 

They were in view of the fortress, and right outside the drawbridge were two tired war steeds galloped into view. These beasts with them had the bodies of nude men, attached to the sattles by their broken limbs. Their pale counterpart glazemen had fleshtones impure with a sickening shit flavor, like mud.

In other words, these men tied to steed, they were covered on a disgusting shit that caked their bodies in the hot sun. Surprisingly they survived the journey without eating the shit, and then puking their guts out violently. 

The two scouts slowed in the grazing field to meet the duel steeds now coming into view, but they continued past, all the way to the water defense where these exhausted beasts sipped the murky fluids, given they would soon die of dehydration from the run.

Pantis sat indoors as this happened, but the trumpets were played from man to man, from the farthest side of the stronghold, to the doors of the Keep. The governor was mapping out the base with his leftover officers, when a knight rushed through the doors unannounced. 

"Two men are here. Survivors." 

"They bring forth words of grace? Or words of disgrace?" 

"Words to kill our race..." 

"Then we bring our boys home, then spite these fools without taste once they besiege our last line." 

"Aye sir!" 

The quartermaster ordered five rambunctious loyal ones to walk out into the forest as intended decoy, aside with the corpsed animals dotted in the wilderness. The armies were now in view of the Lord in the tower, but he thought it would be a couple hours before arrival. Pantis could feel the shaking of drum and cannon combined. The defenses were not set just yet, as Pantis thought they had time, but it was clear as day he was wrong.

Right as the men entered the deep treeline and almost were lost, there was the sound of crashing over all the battles in the distance, and the area they marched into was instantly engulfed by a white smoke. Horses on the patty fields were startled by the rupture, and started going crazy. Bugles played without the Lord's given word, every man now witnessing the ordeal. Archers started to run to the walls, climbed ladders up, or took the stairs, where they were preparing their remaining missiles. Lines of men running up where they could, in surprising formation. But was it enough? 

Guns were carried slower up the walls, but they managed. The archers followed up behind a shorter line of gunners by the two left and right defenses, where the bridge sat in between below. These bowmen and repeaters aiming in the sky. The powdershot troopers either using sticks to line up shaky hold, or leaning up against the wall itself with their guns. 

It was then that smoke had begun to sweep through the forests opening, all the way out to the drawbridge an incredible length. The five brave ones were evidently sucked into the trap. "Damn that Bumblestomp!" Governor Pantis screamed ferociously, and all were then heard distinctly in the forest, screaming as they died, the cannons firing. Pantis was furious, with all of his tricks foiled by a smarter Bumblestomp out of nowhere. The corpsed animals did not deter starving peasants, as he would realize. 

A soldier skipped steps to the tower where Pantis overlooked in awe. 

"Sir! They're here. They're here! You said it'd be a couple hours until!" 

"Clear as day private, so defend your peoples or witness death! I miscalculated."

"Damn straight!" 

Dozens of sillouttes then showed in the opening, as the closest cloud of smoke dissipated inches by the fort. Of course the lesser souls of peasant status like fodder were sent first. Promised fine coin and ample stomachs full. They started to accumulate in a mass, now an estimated two hundred. They seemed to hesitate after leaving the fort’s protection, but a horn sent them into a frenzy towards the forest with pitchforks, some with shorter blades, some with nothing at all. The commanders gave a hand signal on the walls, standing on chairs behind. A drum riff made clear, and the voices mostly similar. "Loose." 

Arrows answered scum, and every skipped archer behind was told to shoot one missile so they could conserve ammo. Some peasants in their farmers outfits, suspenders, as well as cowboy hats had begun to collapse in the front as they charged. These defenders continued routine two more volleys until the senior officer yelled to the other walls through a cone, standing behind his marksmen on a highstool. "Their general is in the back!" 

Troopers acknowledged this sentiment, and the archers were told to aim lower to reach the Gay leader. More volleys ensued, and finally the mob was wiped out and the stragglers running for their lives. The Goreic master dead under his own in the field. 

A second smoke appeared far off to the right, the mens celebrations died down. 

"It's not over..."

Muskets quickly angled to the source in their positions. The cloud remained longer this time, a group of four seen coming out to entertain the attack. 

"That's all?" 

They appeared weak, in civilian outfits, but this time they were smarter, all four men brandishing large serpentines, fearlessly aiming barrels ahead, before blasting fireballs in the defenders positions. Semi-automatic in clear synchronization. Long streams of fire carried bombs over in response, all guns going off louder than any Bronze Glaze siege shot. Fast like bullets, one of the bombs landed spot on, creating a spectacular display of pink mist and dirt pick up, killing useful muskets. One bomb landing short outside, and the last one slamming into the side of a wall, shaking the foundations center. 

Men were told not to fire their guns, but several violated and spent their precious balls in panic. One senior officer fell off his stool nearby, a quake knocking him down. Enraged and sweating profusely, he got back up, torn ceremonial cloth, and limped over to beat the stupids with the steel on a pistol, first firing his only round point-blank in a traitors kneecap. The fools had never seen their master swear so much in life, and being shot was a 'no go,' so they sharpened up and stopped wasting their missiles. They hit nothing when firing their powder, the four cannon boys already running back into their smokescreen with heavy contraptions.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Description</b></font>

For one to be spooned, you must remove their clothing and firmly strap them into your position of choosing. The victim will be slouched downward, revealing the depths. You must stuff said spoon into the victims chocolate inventory, removing all of its contents. Start by penetrating through the rim, inserting an opposite route, then plunging it deep further. Once you scoop out a creamy, sticky substance, start scooping slower to increase pain. Continue scooping until the 'canal' is fully breached, then sit back, and enjoy the sights of the victim being drained.

The Ride of Tears is among the most shameful ways to die in the Hard-Glazed society, more-so than spooning. Those executed on the Ride of Tears are normally murderers. Indeed, similar to spooning, those executed on the Ride of Tears lose all hierarchical status and all their heirs are nullified if they are of formerly noble stature. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>The Contraption</b></font>

The Ride of Tears consists of an extra-tall water-slide, standing at approximately twenty-five feet tall. It is three feet wide and about thirty feet long. The water-slide, however, is filled to the brim with razorblades and other sharp blades, beginning at about the four-foot mark on the way down. Those condemned to die have their hands tied, are blindfolded, drenched with honey to lubricate them, and forced down the slide by two powderboys, each armed with a pike. If the condemned is still alive by the time he reaches the bottom, at which point he will have likely lost several limbs and all of the skin on his back, several nearby beekeepers will let their bees loose upon him, to feast upon the honey and his flesh. After the condemned is expired, they are transported to the Iron Gate of Glaze to be displayed outside, for the doors have not opened in centuries.

Black and drifting aimlessly as locked in port, these ferocious warriors above their Death Ships go by the common nickname of the Blagoonie Sailor Sweets. This name stems from Booby Blagoona's recorded sneak into one of these vastly superior Death Ships, without documentation, without purpose it would seem, but many knew in the aftermath that he did it for one reason, to exploit the greatest nation on Earth. God bless his nasty soul. These whaling ships are guarded by some of the most elite protection leagues under Hard-Glaze legislature and authorities.

It was said on the day of April, late era of Holy Hierarchy, that these immense ships were first spotted off the coast of Madagascar, and from there their highest commanding officer of the navy and royal estates -- Lord Maximus, stood atop the vessels quarter deck, just below the main sail, as he protruded out over the railing as the waves and low currents settled around the top commanding Death Ship in the Hard-Glaze armada. "Ahoy, we've made it alas!" -- Lord Maximus' first words of rejoice, as he and his superior officers made landfall onto the coast of Madagascar. "Alas, bring me two men to the crows nest, and prepare me a meal from the galley..." But soon enough, the entire fleet in its formation encountered a rather intimidating foe around the rocky cliffs of the coast. It was a darkhide pirate vessel, and beyond that, many more of them in a line, swiftly maneuvering into the direction of the setting sun so that they could aim starboard side their smaller barrel cannons at the Hard-Glaze armada, as it clearly lacked the readiness to dispense ammunitions back if to be attacked by the fleet, moving in a forward line. The top officer, below the stature of Lord Maximus, ordered a sailor man to ride the bowsprit of the boat, and gaze his binoculars in direction to the incoming fleet that would be turning its guns in direction of Lord Maximus' ship in front of every other vessel. This course of action left the sailor with his life lost in the depths of the sea, as a response to this was the darkhides and their stolen cannons, discharging the first shots that ignited conflict. As one might imagine, the warm waters would prove a manageable one for this sailor to remain in the depths for a little longer than frigid waters, but no. He was without delay, smashed by the frontal portion of Lord Maximus and his ship, leaving the sailor as the first casualty of Hard-Glaze and the Death Ships.

With little time to spare, Lord Maximus and his entire armada was ordered to line up, and begin their starboard side engagement. The first five minutes were crucial, and this meant that everything had to be timed perfectly -- And it indeed was. All ships lined up, one to the next, and began to fire their first warning shots at the darkhide fleet, and just as the first shots were directed in the waters aside the darkhides and their boats, these fucklets started their policy of total destruction, sinking the first Death Ship right next to Lord Maximus' frigate. "All men to the starboard side, prepare to engage these disgusting peasants with everything you got, fire all cannons!" and so the men moved to their positions on every ship, all ships giving the same order. Every warship in the Hard-Glaze fleet began their circling maneuvers in direction to the attackers aboard their pretty ships, there were a total of six ships in attacking distance - Lord Maximus controlling one of them, so three ships broke up from the armada and began their maneuvering procedure. Three ships going left, three ships going right, and so this began the onslaught of the pirates and their boats in the Madagascar strait. All Death Ships equipped with hot oil, and even Lord Maximus' frigate armed with a recreation of the Leonardo da Vinci Triple Barrel Cannon invention, using that instinctively to bombard the hell out of incoming darkhide ships as the ship began its tactical pursuit. These were the first tactical orders of the commander and his fleet in Hard-Glaze name, moving the six ships, all in different directions to surround the darkhides and their attempted slaughter of noblemen aboard Hard-Glaze Death Ships. 
]]

Book_Deathships_Page4 = [[
As Lord Maximus' frigate and other surrounding Death Ships managed to pin the floaters in the middle, it was then that a top ranked official ordered every ship to begin the ultimatum, exposing a pure red flag above the main frigates main topmast, indicating the firing of all starboard sides in addition to the new prototype weapons that latched to each forecastle deck, able to make a full 360 degree turn in their very technologically advanced state, all aboard these devastating Death Ships. These new prototypes were called the 33 Barreled Organ Guns, and they proved their point by destroying at least five ships in one volley, all guns firing simultaneously. Just as the flag was lowered to pronounce the death of many darkhide ships, another top ranked official in the commanding frigate ordered an oil exposure, each corresponding ship expelling its nutrients of blazing hot oil over the pirates that fell into the depths. The oil quickly stuck to each enemy of the state, burning them to a roast despite being in the water.

Soon after the elites of Hard-Glaze military action let loose their hell barrage on the fishing vessels, another nearby armada had arrived after receiving an S.O.S signal from the controlling frigate, beginning their barrage on the rest of the retreating fleet with Special Class Battle Barges, each armed to the bone with many cannons on every side of it, much like a pillbox. These floating machines of war created a hailstorm of fire, and left the smell of blood in the air after leaving nothing but decimation in their holy name. The aftermath was nothing more but a display of Hard-Glaze superiority in warm Eastern waters. Ultimately it showed truly the might of a nation advanced and clearly growing more and more powerful by the years. The Hard-Glaze commanders at the first naval engagement in Holy Hierarchy gave the land-based darkhides a chance to fish out their corpsed women and children who were aboard the fleet of servitude. It was a horrid sight for sore eyes, one would simply only agree to. As one Hard-Glaze commander said during the aftermath of the bloody engagement, with only one Death Ship destroyed and all one-hundred and twenty of its crew killed in the strait, "It was horrible. It's a shame the Powder Boys only arrived late to the party to ruin such in their fleet of intolerance!"
]]

Book_Deathships_Page5 = [[
Other officers spoke to the press of what had occurred in the strait of Madagascar, but only in small, broken up words as they too, were devastated by the conflict of losing merely one and simply one ship. This backed up the point that these Death Ships carried some of the elites of Hard-Glaze nobility and highly trained sailors, so it was known for devastation to be felt after the casualty count came through. 

<i>"We have a ruination in our ... 

... midst, the waste of good nobles ... 

... and sailors alike, such a pity ... 

... that they too were washed in the ... 

... waters of the East, only after ... 

... pledging to conquer such ... 

... intolerable scum." </i>

And so the day folded over, and the scum failed ever again to decimate another Death Ship into the modern period. God bless for that prophecy to be fulfilled.

When Fucker Joe, A.K.A Joseph A. Philadelphus, who was known as a Hard-Glaze genocidal killer who ravaged the rural area in the 16th District, kidnapping over 400 people and killing them all. The killer fixated his eyes on a new target of interest. It was the Governors Plantation, commonly referred to by commanding leaders in council meetings as Farmstead 8, or Castle 8. A heavily fortified plantation with a castle established on top of a hill. This well-defended area was Fucker Joe's interest, and he wanted so dearly to plot terrible things against the Glazic Union and strike them deep and hard. So he prepared a week-long annihilation idea of his, to attack mobile, in his vehicle and blaze the crops and all of the inhabitants with the machine gun mounted to it. This was no ordinary plot, he went into full depth with it, deciding what to do in the event he were caught. He had suicide pills, explosive grenades, Molotov Cocktails, handcuffs, and other various tools to attack with. Fucker Joe decided he would use the handcuffs to subdue the Governor and interrogate/torture him in his very own fortified Mansion on top of the hill, while using ducktape to strap make-shift explosives to various places, giving him an advantage, and then he would toss grenades from his windows while in motion as he made his escape from the burning farm. It was an elaborate plot it seemed, but for the Governor, he knew that Fucker Joe was coming. He had a prediction the night prior to the attack. 

A 'vision' one would consider, but experts concluded that it could have been a hallucination after taking various drugs in his mansion the following night, and in addition to having been with many mistresses, which may have led it up to be a mere coincidence. The vision was said to have sparked a new era of alert mentality for governors all mingled, as the governor simply put in his personal agenda papers the night the vision occurred in his mind. The man behind the ink pen wrote and recorded the finest vision ever produced by a Governor in a smaller township region, rumoring the demise of himself and his high-ranking officials as he saw in his horrible vision, though merely as sacrifice to Hard-Glaze and death as honorable as possible with a flowerbed to be pronounced at his funeral.

The Governor's name was Tom 'Albert' Roberto, a man of Hispanic background with roots deep in the Spanish colonization of the Southern lands. He was a ferocious warrior, with at least ten or more gold medals of certification for his success in many fronts. 

He took on the Amish during the beginning days of Holy Hierarchy Wars, decimating them first, and then tackling the darkhides and even the proclaimed Redneck Allegiance Party, proposing Lord Maximus with his trusty hand in combat. Of course after all of these situations, Lord Maximus took note of this well-played master of chess, purchased a Steed representing the Philimonjio and his journey to control all east of the Hard-Glaze lands, and then offered it as a token of gratitude for Alberto. A gift it seemed. It was a brutal display of honorary status for Alberto. Though it was truly remarkable to see him and his armor-clad horse riding into combat, blazing hordes of tribals as they ran from the battlefield. Indeed, Alberto was a man to be worshipped by Hard-Glaze predecessors, riding as a shining example of enlightenment in Hard-Glaze name. Beauty inside, much like Blagoona's speeches, but on a sincere Hard-Glaze level. It was reported that Alberto had a fine acquired taste for things 'bling' in their natural element. He desired products that were shipped far and few to the Hard-Glaze capital, where he would prance much like a tribal in applause to what had just purified him -- The liquor he desired so much, which in coincidence to Fucker Joe's soon-to-be ravaging of a liquor house, in a town not so far from where the action would occur.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>The Event that Shook The County</b></font>

It was the following morning that Fucker Joe began his demonic pursuit for destruction on a national level, all that would inevitably hit Glazic news stations around Hard-Glazed society. As remembered by several eye-witnesses, they all reportedly saw Fucker Joe enter a small township two miles outside the road of notorious Castle 8, where he picked up a plentiful amount of alcoholic beverages to consume while he inflicted sickening slaughter on weaklings..

Joe knew he would have to blast his way through the beverage store in order to obtain his liquor, and that he indeed did, leaving entrails behind the counter where the man was mercilessly fucked beyond repair in his own business. 

Hours later would be remarkably one of the most disgusting acts of war on Hard-Glaze by a third-party member, the Fucker Joe... His ruthless behavior left a scar on the Glazic stature entirely, causing many nationally titled politicians of Glaze to call him out as a coward in their own words. It was said that during the following morning, after blasting his way into a liquor store to obtain his precious substance, he started up the engine to his vehicle and prepared to ride gloriously into the farmstead of Castle 8, where he would ultimately shoot up more innocent bystanders, and so he did that, in fact. The minute drive left nobody time to escape the demise. Commentators of the farmstead speak in words frightening to many, telling a tale unlike no other. It was said as the engine was heard like a howling wind in the distance, a siren started to blare from the Castle’s alert system. 
]]

Book_Assault_Page4 = [[
This old fashioned device was still in use from years prior, but served its purpose well. The combination of sirens going off and the engine howling left people emotionally scarred. Slaves from all directions took off from their stations, most of them unable to escape but some proven lucky to break the binds of metal around their arms. Many of these workers were chained to their legs as well, unable to fend for themselves, as the engine became increasingly louder... and that soon resolved with the death sounds in the distance too. "Attention, attention... We have a predicament in our midst," the audio man spoke out, it was the Governor Alberto, attempting to ensure everyone's safety was secure.... clearly it was not, as people were mowed down upon the vehicles breach of the outer gates to the facility. Many darkhides towards the front stretch were shot down by the heavy-caliber vehicle strap-on, the entire car shaking unsteadily in its own machinery turbulence, leaving at least more of the workers towards the back of the field to attempt to escape unscathed... 

At least five dozen peasants were initially brought down by the onslaught at the gate, as the rolling wheels continued down dirt paths and into the very beautiful cobble-stone that marked the beginning of the Castle. Molotov Cocktails were seen being tossed recklessly from each side window, as the wheels then caught on fire from the method man's very own cocktails that fell too short, some however reaching their targets and blackening peasants into a darker color it seemed. Then came the grenade volleys.. It seemed as though hundreds of these tiny explosive grenades started being tossed out of the windows in a variety of ways. Some of the grenades clearly inside garbage bags to maximize devastation on the workers. Limbs fried in the breeze, bodies strewn across the dirt and cobble-stone, and not a security official able to weaken the Fucker’s defenses. More reports came in from the on-ground witnesses, telling more of the story as the muscle car drove up the hill where the castle was positioned. 
]]

Book_Assault_Page5 = [[
"Get the f-fucking rifle, Johnny!" -- The words of Alberto to his personal security guard, the man besides Alberto named Johnny scrambling quickly to toss him a beer-keg barrel that contained the goodies, then kicking the sucker over onto the floor where the Governor resumes to load many loose single bullets into a magazine of his rifle -- A considerably drawn-out process that left the fate of the Castle in both of their hands. The Governor then threw his full body weight against the balcony door to his bedroom, smashing it down with his fat obnoxious body, stepped out onto the top balcony of his bedroom window, where he took a glimpse of all of his profits being thrown down the drain, or in other words, thrown in the air to burn. He aimed down the sights and unleashed a full magazine of hollow point tracer rounds in direction to the oncoming Muscle Car, the car clearly not stopping at this point. The Governor then watched in awe as the muscle car drove away and rolled quickly outside of the fortified Castle gate from the side entrance, leaving dust in every face, and never to be seen again by Alberto or his crew. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>The Aftermath & The Scorched Earth Policy</b></font>

It was said that in the aftermath of the attack of Fucker Joe on Alberto's precious cargo, half-consumed liquor bottles and blood all tainted the land and prevented further occupation and work. It took weeks after the attack for things to be considered "normal" again for Alberto and his crew, and although much of the prophecies that Alberto envisioned never occurred, the one that did stick in his mind for the rest of his life, was the original vision of his castle being assaulted. As one responsible Glazic commander would order, the Scorched Earth Policies came after the outbreak of Fucker Joe, in response to what he performed on Alberto's precious cargo. Said to have been one of the biggest epidemics in Glazic history, the retardation and drunkards that consume so much alcohol per household is surely to be locked on the charts for future priority-makers in the Central Regions today.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Karmine Willtan </b></font>

<i>"I've not a man nor a prophet. Simply an inferno."</i>
—Karmine Willtan - When asked if he was a man or god by a serf.

Karmine Willtan (b. 4E), is a Minister of Glazic Faith within the County Districts. His works are well known across the entirety of the Hierarchy, as his teachings led to the building of the Faith Ministry, the replacement of the inferior Royal Pope system. Willtan is said to be the first man, born as a peasant, to rise to the Small Council due to his political cunning. Even more admirable was his efforts to root out the spread of the Goreic Faith, a puppet religion system.

Many wonder if Willtan was once a firm believer of the Goreic Faith before his time serving on the Small Council, due to his high level of knowledge about the nature of the Goreic Faith itself. Philosophers explained his wide level of knowledge of all topics, including those with controversial themes. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Early Life</b></font>

Karmine Willtan was believed to be born a peasant of a different name. His life consisted of heavy labor, working side by side with the darkhides as he was believed to be of Slavic or Hispanic descent. This, of course, was confirmed to be a slanderous lie as later DNA testing proved him to be a Philimonjio Superior. Willtan, though not renowned as a poet, produced various sonnets describing his laborious stay in the county districts. The sonnets documented his struggles, including the time a peasant had stolen his grapefruit, forcing him to retrieve the grapefruit from the man’s skull.

Book_Karmine_Page2 = [[
<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Rise to Power </b></font>

It is still up to speculation on how Karmine Willtan received the knowledge necessary to become a spreader of the Glaze. To be born a peasant and exhibit vast wisdom is indeed a rare thing. Willtan himself refused to comment on how he gained such information, stating that "I was born in darkness, but then I saw the light. Nothing more." Lord Maximus himself hand-picked Willtan to replace the previous Minister of Faith, who was executed by crucifixion for suspicion of malicious intent upon the Council Pedestal. Karmine Willtan accepted the offer, and was transported to the Palace of the Small Council. His first years on the Council were indeed hard ones, as the noblemen refused to accept him for his lack of true noble blood. In a legendary show of fervor, Willtan retrieved a dagger which he used to cut his arm, drawing blood as he exclaimed, "Am I not appointed by Sol? Do I not shed blood for the Glaze?" From then on he was acknowledged, but it will be many years before he will be truly accepted as an equal, if at all. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Goreic Purges</b></font>

When delivering a speech upon the current state of the Council Pedestal and the Hierarchy itself, a peasant interrupted the scene and hefted a heavy stone at Karmine Willtan. Due to its inferior genetics, the slave missed its aim, hitting another man in the crowd. Before being shot down by guardsmen, the pagan yelled out "Death to the Glaze and rise to the Gay Gore!" Willtan took note of this, as the entire rest of the day he was reported to be very distressed, running down the halls of the palace, banging his head against the walls and throwing pots and pans and silverware across the corridors. 
]]

Book_Karmine_Page3 = [[
Finally, when his anger subsided, he rallied a peasant folk militia to march into the county district, aided by various paramilitary forces, including the famous Powderboys, influenced by coffers. What came next remains controversial, as many small capital companies were devastated by lack of laborers due to the mass slaughterings that happened in their districts. Willtan refrained from doing an all-out massacre, and instead occupied the districts with his forces, ending the problem by its roots and not by the stem. A famous and ingenious act occurred when Karmine began a public preach of the Goreic Faith, posing as a Goreic Minister. This, of course, was a ruse and served as a spotlight that attracted all Goreic believers like moths to a light. When his speech concluded, the Powderboys, poised in machine gun towers, began spraying down on all those who attended the preaching, leaving none alive, as Karmine witnessed the glory firsthand.  

The slaughterings began shortly afterwards, burning down shantytowns and small villages as the Faithmen ravaged the county districts, the same ones where Karmine Willtan himself was born. The same darkling who stole Willtan's grapefruit in his early years was identified and brought forth to Willtan, who executed him with a gold-plated .44 Magnum, after stating the words "Look at you now, your head is nothing but pink mist." The total death count was comparable to the Reductions of the Fourth Era, but due to how long and spread out the massacres were, historians refuse to accept this act as an Official Genocide.

<i>"Almighty creator, deity, holiness, idol of mine. Give me power, spirit, allegiance with those who have disbanded from my ordnance of an army. Divine overseer, universal forces be with me. And for those demons, fight back in means to protect Hard-Glaze and society from its inevitable destruction. Dump the spiritual trophies for now, and unload the ammunition to purify these unfaithful sinners of the land. Stockpile the explosives, magazine the rifles, warehouse the vehicles, but most of all, plant the inflorescence of Hard-Glaze society inside the dirt for future generations to come."</i>
— Lord Maximus XII, beginning his march on the tribes in the First Era during the Holy Hierarchy wars.

On the silver saddle piece, it shows a carving of a trademark symbol, and the globe in the glove of the Lord, as he stands on his pedestal. 

He wears the glove to give off the symbolism that he cannot stand the grotesque values of the peasant backbone. Therefore, he uses their simple mind as a tool to his regime, for it is his to use.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Origins</b></font>

It was the beginning of the time for one to decide the fate of the world. His name was Lord 'Henry-Harrison' Maximus, a brilliant scholar of talents. His name stemmed from his royal heritage. It was a brilliant time for him to decide the fate of many in the region. It was a time of tribal justice, but he knew that there were alternatives involved. The Unenlightened Fucklets grew restless, and with that, came the possibility of war. It was real to Lord Maximus, it was no-longer child's play. It was outright war. And with war, came genocide. And with genocide, came coffers drained. And with that, was death and finality. He aged from royalty as a man of golden status. He was truly the brightest of the bunch.
]]

Book_Maximus_Page2 = [[
Many knew that it was time for Maximus to move on in the world, and so he did. Financially he was set, but intellectually he was staggering. He had to obtain knowledge from key resources throughout the land. And so he did, without tribulation.

The unruly would take years, even decades for one to finally convince this flaming beast otherwise. It was a meek understanding by those who were a part of it, that this creature of fire would decay the world forever. The objectives were certain in this notion: Destroy the lessers in means to save the world. And did they not destroy the fucked ones? Yes, they in-fact did. Today is a living example of that. Nevertheless, the alertness of the retard gave understanding to Lord Maximus.

"Vigilance is key to the world's survival", as Maximus told others countless times in his journey to the top. "Discretion is key", He would also say, during countless meetings around the world. This man of golden status was not only the scholar we knew of in his time, but surely a god. A god with arms, limbs, and a head on his shoulders.  

The year was of the Holy Hierarchy Wars, when the Unenlightened Fucklets had grown stronger, and strong enough to raise hell on the landscape. Cities burned, crumbling to the ground. People gave up. They turned towards any religious artifacts they had, and prayed with those artifacts that one day this hell on earth would end.

Book_Maximus_Page3 = [[
<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Age of Innocence</b></font>

The age of innocence, as some would have called it. They were the days of agitation for Lord Maximus. A common pre-conceived notion of Lord Maximus, is that he lived the life of glory. But what's commonly mistaken for those to see, is that he was not glorious during his 'earlier' years, but in-fact innocent. This personal belief or judgement, has led Lord Maximus to the brink of destroying his own people. And with that, comes the possibility of never giving them the receiving side of things. Lord Maximus' childhood was a violent one, a noisy one. A commotion indeed as many would agree to these words. There was anxiety, restlessness, and an overall sense of insecurity amongst the royal family. The man that raised Maximus, for starters, was a drunkard. A disgusting wench of a man.

And yes Maximus, a thinker at the time, was correct. It was during Lord Maximus' childhood that gave him a bitter impression of his father. And with that, he carried with him for the rest of his life.

This age of innocence was surely a huge misconstrued outbreak in Lord Maximus' life.      

Maximus had a choice to decipher what this all meant, or continue to ignore it as he did at some points in his time. All would render him confused and outright angry and disorderly. But sure enough, there was a translation years later, with the arrival of John Stegmore, a political analyst of the time before Lord Maximus rose to the nobility during the years of reconstruction of Hard Glaze.      
]]

Book_Maximus_Page4 = [[
But then, as the Hard-Glazed Phillimonjios grew and prospered, there came a threat from within.

Long before the time of Lord Maximus and the Glaze, there grew a civilization in ancient America known as the black-hats. But as the clouds of radiation set in, the black-hats became something extraordinarily evil. Gone were their formerly pacifist ways. Before long, all knew to fear the sight of their black blood.

However, at the time, both Lord Maximus and his contemporaries knew something was amiss. For several months, there had been many black-hat incursions into Hard-Glazed territory. Reports from the counties flooded into the capital district, of mutant men in robes and tall hats attacking villages, butchering the populace, and feasting upon the livestock.      

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Campaigns & Expansion</b></font>

Lord Maximus would not stand for the treachery taking place in his provinces. He swiftly sent for his top generals, and devised a plan. He would levy the peasants to attack black-hat caravans in overwhelming numbers, while his main army pillaged and razed their towns, ensuring their total destruction. After a conflict (known today as the Amish wars) lasting only a few mere months, the black-hats were completely eradicated. 
]]

Book_Maximus_Page5 = [[
With his border secure and new lands acquired, Lord Maximus set his sights west, to the coast occupied by independent Glazic fanatics. After quickly overrunning the scattered rabble, Lord Maximus had increased the size of his empire almost twofold. 

However, the looming threat were the hundreds of darkhide tribes to the east. 

After launching an assault and enslaving or killing the entirety of fifty tribes, Lord Maximus was repulsed at the Battle of the District 10. With this crushing defeat, Lord Maximus tactically retreated to the border, fortifying the entire border with a wall of howitzers and other arms, both large and small, whilst he made plans for his next expedition into these lands.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>The Wars of the Holy Hierarchy</b></font>

Expansions came years later  in the wars of Holy Hierarchy. It was a storm of vigilance on the tribal populace. A fury frenzy of gold-plated soldiers racing their feet to break into compounds that fell to the tribes. It wasn't unusual for a tribal army to fling piles of fecal matter at the retreating Hard-Glaze soldiers within distance to them. Orgies of soldiers would confiscate the land's treasures and then either throw them in a corner of the compound, or simply hold on to these treasures for no understanding at all. Savages of the more harmonious types, would be reluctant to melt down these treasures for profit. But not all thought that way, and as a result, many decided to ill-mindedly throw these treasures away rather than doing the deed for profits. Valued silvers, gems, crystals, and other corresponding items of ceremonial use were taken to the homeland. It would seem as though these possessions of monetary value were simply ditched. The savage had no idea in his mind how to profit from any of it.
]]

Book_Maximus_Page6 = [[
It was during the later years of the Holy Hierarchy Wars, that all of the pandemonium died down, in what seemed to be a truce of sorts. This time of peace was also a time of great growth in population. When all mayhem seemed to burn away in the midst of the Holy Hierarchy Wars, the neutrality came clear. This time frame of the conquest era was named 'The Pacification' which seemed to do just that. Though not exactly a treaty, it was more of an agreement to put down all arms and discontinue all military campaigns for a brief period to calm down. The coffers that were drained no-longer continued to be drained. The average death stopped as well. 

But then, the bombs began to fall. Entire cities were erased by the will of the Glaze. Both sides were drawn into a total war, in which neither would stop fighting until the one had been completely erased. This unprecedented conflict claimed billions of lives, and nearly caused the collapse of society, were it not for Lord Maximus' divine intervention. 

Not much is known about the late years of the Holy Hierarchy, but what is known is that the Hard-Glazed Phillimonjios prevailed in the face of insurmountable odds, due the efforts of Lord Maximus in preserving the Hard-Glazed system. Indeed, many cities were reduced to ash, but in the aftermath of this pyrrhic victory, the Glaze reigned supreme. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Post-Holy Hierarchy Wars</b></font>

In the aftermath of the apocalyptic Holy Hierarchy Wars, Lord Maximus' empire was reduced to rubble and dirt. However, despite the destruction of pre-established cities, the territory under his control had tripled, as all tribes in the known world had been pacified (during the Cleansing of Unruly). The Inquisition, which ensured that every black-hat and savage not in submission was destroyed, now found itself without purpose. And so, in a demonstration of his noble stature, Lord Maximus granted all former Inquisition members vast estates in a show of generosity. 
]]

Book_Maximus_Page7 = [[
However, upon finding out that the Inquisition (which in their opinion did not contribute to total victory) were being so generously rewarded for their invaluable service by Lord Maximus, the Glazic Armed Forces revolted. Over 250,000 well-armed men besieged District 1, in the largest siege known to mankind to date. The capital's walls and infrastructure were still weak from the sackings of the Holy Hierarchy, but the Maximilian Guard (who bear the Lord's name), staunchly defended it. Lord Maximus knew he could count on his force of expertly trained, steadfast, and most importantly fanatically loyal elites, but they were outnumbered five to one. 

The capital, District 1, was far too large for the 250,000 man force to encircle, and so they set up 9 camps around the city. In the case of a breakout attempt, there would always be reinforcements from both sides. The troops elected their ringleader and General Booby A. Harvington (not to be confused with the latter Booby Blagoona) as the new leader, directly challenging Lord Maximus' right to the Throne of Sol. They devised a plan. The troops would wait until the population of District 1 began to revolt due to pestilence and famine, and then would use the distraction to assault. In the meantime, they would prepare siege engines for their assault. 

Meanwhile, Lord Maximus had not been idle inside the city walls. Delivering many speeches, he rallied public support and established new farms inside the ruins of the Royal Senate grounds, which encompassed over a sixth of the city. Even though the aqueducts and sewers had been shelled by the apostates, disease did not break out. The siege lasted for six months. Because of these factors, the deserters began to become impatient.

<b>The First Assault</b>

Pressured by his officers and nearly-mutinous troops, General Booby began preparations for the final assault. Several obstacles stood in his way. The main bridge leading into the city, and most importantly, to the symbolic Iron Gate of Glaze, was extremely well defended. The General ordered his artillery to fire on the defenders, with limited success, but ceased firing to prevent the bridge's destruction. The General then ordered his elite shock troops, veterans of Lord Maximus' conquests of the Black-Hats to advance across the bridge. Covered by General Booby's best crossbowmen, the elite swordsmen crossed the bridge slowly. The defending force, a contingent of about five hundred Maximilian Guard, did not back down against the force of five thousand advancing upon them. Volleys of crossbow fire rained down on the defenders, but did little damage due to the defender's superior armor and shields. Meanwhile, across the city, the secondary force of over 80,000 regulars began advancing to the walls with massive siege towers pulled by mules. Boxer H. Krammy describes what happened next in his Glazica Historica written in the early Fourth Era: 

<i>"At sunrise, the six-story siege towers which had been immobile for weeks began advancing across the plains on the south side of the capital. Lord Maximus happened to be on the southern walls at this time. The Glazic gunners took note of the siege towers being pulled by mules, rather than conventionally pushed from behind. Lord Maximus shouted with his thunderous voice "”Give them the steel", and so, the steel was given."</i>
—Boxer H. Krammy - Glazica Historica 
]]

Book_Maximus_Page8 = [[
The mules were promptly gunned down by Lord Maximus' dragoons, who fired the Glazic Blunderbuss, to great effect. With the south walls momentarily secure, Lord Maximus rode by horseback to the north of the District, where the elites of both were engaged in combat. During his ride, Lord Maximus was met by many civilians who threw themselves at his horse's feet and praised his divinity. Arriving at the Iron Gate of Glaze, Lord Maximus found his guard in a precarious situation. There were only a hundred defenders left out of the original five hundred Maximilian Guard. 

<b>A Time of Reckoning</b>

Determined to turn the tide of the battle, Lord Maximus summoned his closest advisors to the towers above the Iron Gate. Proclaiming that he still had tricks up his sleeve, Maximus announced his intention to hold the bridge at all costs. Meanwhile, the defenders were being reduced one-by-one from the onslaught of swordsmen and crossbow bolts. Suddenly, from over the tops of the walls, masses of darkhides, clad in white powder and with sharpened sticks, began spilling out. During the months under siege, Lord Maximus had bestowed upon his massive slave population the honor of joining the Philimonjio army. The powder-clad warriors had their senses overloaded from their new-found power, and became fanatically loyal to the divine Maximus. Lord Maximus’ Powderboys were unleashed, and in Lord Maximus' own words, "A time of reckoning has come".

Over the heads of their comrades they leapt, and began a slaughter of the heretical swordsmen. A mass rout began after over a thousand of General Booby's best men died in a minute or less. Mirroring Lord Maximus' actions at the Battle of District 10, General Booby ordered his artillery to fire on his own men, to destroy the immensely powerful Powderboys. However, the Powderboys were too fast in cutting down the General's men, and began sprinting towards his artillery, with nothing but victory on their minds. Still, over the walls more came like an endless wave. In a turn of events that would glorify the Powderboys for centuries to come, they murdered over 100,000 men in a mere half an hour. 

On the south end, the heretics were taking fire from the Glazic gunners, and had begun shelling back with cannons that were previously out of range to make room for the siege towers. The Powderboys circled around the city in both directions, murdering every single man in the camps surrounding the city. However, the Powderboys were momentarily stalled when they began sacking the camps instead of advancing. This proved almost fatal for Lord Maximus, as the south walls came crashing down under the combined barrage of hundreds of guns. Lord Maximus reminded the Powderboys that there would be time to loot once the battle was over, and that if they lost there would be none. 

Motivated once more, the Powderboys completed the encirclement, and advanced into the heretics' rear as they were attempting to spill into the city (but blocked by Maximillian' pikes). General Booby's position was eventually overrun, and he was brought back to Lord Maximus alive by his orders. Following his capture, Booby would endure 40 years of constant torture before finally succumbing to his 38th spooning.

<i>"You speak so highly as to consider yourself a tributary? Then if God wills it, give this man his honorable celebration. Vile thing, remember these words! Corpse the savage, but do not corpse the Philimonjio, for he is spiritual and his integrity is leveled to that of the God that speaks to us in the skies."</i>
—Lord Maximus XII, speaking to the last holdout of Powderboys.

After the eventful conclusion of the wars of the Holy Hierarchy, Lord Maximus had consolidated his power. With his mutinous army subdued and the Unenlightened Fucklets all but eradicated, with the remnants under control, Lord Maximus could again look forward to an age of peace and prosperity. However, this was not to be the case, as several controversies would stand in his way, the first being the most devastating to Lord Maximus' image. 

Enter Booby Blagoona, an immigrant darkhide of above average intelligence and a charisma likened to that of Lord Maximus himself. Some sources say that Booby managed to sneak aboard one of the Empire's infamous Death Ships, waiting in the cargo hold for many days before arriving on the coast. Booby eventually made his way to District 1, an act likely only feasible because of the attention the infamous mass murderer Fucker Joe drew from the Glazic Guard at the time. 
]]

Book_Maximus_Page11 = [[
Reportedly, Booby was able to secure a honorary passport from a sympathetic provincial governor (who has since been executed), and as such was able to gain access to District 1 on a false-pretext of inquisitional duties. Once inside, he began a mass campaign for equality on a scale not seen since pre-Glazic times. Booby's speeches in the Royal Square even captivated Lord Maximus, who enjoyed the speeches not for their content but for Booby's eloquence. However, the speeches grew more and more persuasive, and after a captivating speech Booby inadvertently launched one of the largest rebellions to date, with over half of the populace turning against Lord Maximus. 

Lord Maximus' men could not stop the rioters, for they included many soldiers' friends and family. Extensive damage was done to the city, and Lord Maximus' palace was bombarded by Molotov Cocktails and cannons stolen from the city armory. The rioters demanded the head of Lord Maximus, and over the course of the night managed to break into the Royal Palace a total of four times, each time being repulsed by the Maximilian Guard. 

Booby Blagoona was able to calm the rioters by delivering a speech claiming that they should not fight each other. Frenzied riots turned into cheerful protests, but by the time the rioters began to settle down, the Lord's personal army that had accompanied him on many of his greatest victories arrived, as they had received late news of the siege. Armed and equipped with the best gear on the face of the planet, Lord Maximus set his vanguard loose on the mutinous citizens, and in a slaughter that lasted for weeks, around 300,000 dissenters were killed. Booby Blagoona managed to evade capture by being shepherded away by sympathizers and, to this day, his fate remains unknown.

And with that, Lord Maximus was left unchallenged and so began the start of the Second Era and that of Hard-Glazed society, and with it an age of peace.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Fucker Joe</b></font>

Joseph A. Philadelphus, known colloquially as Fucker Joe, was a Hard-Glazed serial killer, kidnapper, and necrophile who murdered several hundred people in the Second Era, before being caught by a detachment of Honor Guard Powderboys (who then ironically murdered him). 

Fucker Joe is infamous for being the primary cause of Lord Maximus' court reforms, including the controversial Fourth Erotica Ban (22), which by extension means he was indirectly responsible for the death of Boxer H. Krammy. This was due to his defense, mainly based on the fact that "a Philimonjio could do nothing wrong." This argument made the trial one of the most difficult and daunting cases in Glazic court history. During his crime spree spanning over multiple eras, the Glazic peoples were stricken by fear, due to the randomness of the victims and Fucker Joe's inability to be caught. 

Executed after an agonizing seventy-four spoonings in the Second Era after being found guilty of no less than 408 counts of kidnapping, 405 counts of assault, 358 counts of murder, and 42 counts of attempted murder, Fucker Joe broke the record for the amount of spoonings endured on Death Row.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Origins</b></font>

Not much is known of Fucker Joe's early life, but several sources from the time indicate that he was born to a peasant farming family in the county district on the outskirts of District 2. Farming was a laborious task, and contributed to Fucker Joe's mind-blowing physique which he would rely on to strangle his victims. 
]]

Book_Fucker_Page2 = [[
After reaching adulthood, Fucker Joe joined the Glazic Royal Army, fighting alongside Lord Maximus' loyal men in the Holy Hierarchy Wars. It is from this training that Fucker Joe truly became the killing machine that was feared by the Glazic populace. On his campaigns with Lord Maximus, Fucker Joe had regular encounters with the worst of humanity, resulting in the inevitable corruption of his mind. Fucker Joe went without treatment, and eventually went mad. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>First Killings</b></font>

After distinguishing himself in service, Fucker Joe was honorably discharged with generous benefits, buying a home and his signature vintage 1970's muscle car, which was later used to run down many victims. Modifications to this car included a frontally-mounted M2 Browning, an enlarged trunk to store victims, and the removal of the passenger-side seat for storage of weapons and tools. 

Fucker Joe, driven mad supposedly, began his rampage in the rural territories of the District 16, kidnapping over 150 people and murdering them all. During his year of activity in District 16 he was averaging just over an abduction per three days. Fucker Joe also infamously drove onto the Governor's plantation (through three fences and several guards), running down many merry-go berry pickin' slaves while they were chained together and defenseless. 

Fucker Joe's car received extensive damage from security, as well as the drug-fuelled Governor firing at him with a repeating carbine from his balcony of his castle-mansion. However, even though his initial objectives were not met, Fucker Joe escaped alive and with his car in working condition. After extensive repairs, Fucker Joe set off to the west to victimize the Central Districts. 
]]

Book_Fucker_Page3 = [[
<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Massacre of Maximillian Forest</b></font>

Leaving the Governor's burning plantation, Fucker Joe took Lord Maximus' extravagant Highway of Victory to District 1, but took a detour into the national park of Maximillian Forest (named after the elite guard of District 1). In the forest he abducted and murdered over fifty people, but two managed to escape with their lives, reporting their encounter with Fucker Joe to the authorities. 

In accordance with Code 46, the Glazic Minister in charge of the National Park dispatched a security force of Powderboys to deal with the man who was terrorizing his grounds. The Powderboy patrol covered an average of fifty miles a day, running in full sprint to find the assailant. 

Fucker Joe, however, was already on his way out of MaximillianForest (having grown bored of it), but unfortunately stumbled upon the Powderboy patrol, which actually numbered in the hundreds. Fucker Joe accelerated his muscle car to speeds which he hadn't thought possible, and began firing the front-mounted .50 cal machine-gun at the wall of powdered boys of noble stature rushing at him in human waves. The .50 cal hollow-point rounds shredded and gored innumerable amounts of the Powderboys, but the powder-clad warriors maintained their advance, and then were promptly run down by the car. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Panic, Final Murders, and Lord Maximus' Divine Intervention </b></font>

By now, most of the Glazic population had heard the rumors of disappearances, murders, and massacres. In District 1, Lord Maximus stood atop the Golden Balcony of his palace, overlooking the chaos and anarchy that consumed District 1. Panic-stricken citizens looted, stole, and burned, as they tried to prepare themselves for the coming of the antichrist. Lord Maximus knew that to stop this chaos he had to personally stop Fucker Joe. 
]]

Book_Fucker_Page4 = [[
Lord Maximus assembled his Maximillian Honor Guard, and dispatched a legion of them (numbering in the 30,000s) to hunt down and kill Fucker Joe. Armed to the teeth with rocket launchers, machine-guns, and heavy rifles, the Powderboy Honor Guard set out from the Iron Gate of Glaze. In actuality, however, the Iron Gate of Glaze was never opened, but was only stated to have opened in government propaganda. 

Meanwhile, Fucker Joe was rampaging through the suburbs of District 1, destroying entire houses full of people while they slept, torching them with a flamethrower. The Honor Guard arrived one night as he was torching a shack from the District 1 sub-overseer's land. The Honor Guard captured and tortured Fucker Joe for two hours outside the walls.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Trial and Spooning</b></font>

In the Grand Courthouse in the grounds of the Royal Senate, Fucker Joe was put on trial for his crimes. Lord Maximus himself was the presiding judge of the case. Fucker Joe, surprising many of those in the courtroom, announced his intention to represent himself in the court of Glazic Law. Indeed, Fucker Joe was an eloquent and persuasive speaker, likely contributing to his success as a serial killer. Fucker Joe's primary defense shocked the civilized world. 

A Philimonjio, he argued, could do no wrong. 

Even Lord Maximus, the creator of Glazic Law and the all-knowing god-king of Philimonjio, was taken aback at this argument. However, Lord Maximus being the cunning superhuman he was, soon regained his composure and countered his point. Proclaiming that Fucker Joe was no longer a Philimonjio by his decree, Lord Maximus quickly invalidated Fucker Joe's argument. He was quickly found guilty and dragged away to the spooning chambers screaming, by two eight foot tall executioners.

I knew that even if the Menace were to be dead, his namesake would continue to violate our consciousness."</i>

To those that read this. Be it discarded by those who are of rival faiths or history that has born leeway in blood. History tells us quite a lot.

All the books and culmination of between the First and Fifth eras have taught me something. Humans exist to fight.

The political works of Krammy and his incentivization of the Royal Senate, the dissolution of said senate by Lord Maximus’ hands, the attack upon the gores Great Tree by Glazic forces, and the scouring of Satan.

It's enough to almost sympathize with he-who-shall-not-be-named. What proof do we have that with his departure, will we even return to greater things? We don't. 

But in this conflict, I learnt a second thing. We fight to exist.

— Saint Ragnar Odwyn

Hard-Glaze historians and literary geniuses of that sort have found it hard to place when exactly Ragnar Odwyn was born or where exactly he originated from, but it is widely accepted that he was a Gay-Gore of Northern stock, a warrior of a barbarous and savage ideal. When Lord Maximus came upon the Gores, mere barbarians in the Deadlands of Canada, and the fragmented tribes and villages that made its whole in the aftermath of the Holy Hierarchy Wars, it is believed that Ragnar was one of the chieftains who stood against him and knelt when his kind were shattered. It was then he, Ragnar, perceived Maximus as the highest ideal, a God in living flesh, and equated him to the nascent belief at the time - that he embodied the Father made flesh, a monster of war given skin and bone. He so decreed he would follow him into the jaws of death itself, and was planted Hard-Glaze forevermore.

<i>"Know that the eternal glory of the Glaze, its beauty and its simplicity, its truth and its power, has come to this place forever. The Light has smothered out the puke of putrid belief we brothers and sisters once believed in, and it has laid the foundations of a greater whole. Do not kneel before delusion, kneel before this elite fucking power."</i>
— Saint Ragnar Odwyn

It is said that after Ragnar Odwyn had unified the tribes of spearfolk around his home underneath the greater banner of the Glaze he had knelt to, that he had changed them so fundamentally. They became zealous, rabid and loyal to Maximus and He alone. They fought entirely for righteousness now, no longer for love of slaughter and looting. His people, the bastard union, huddled in squalid hamlets and tiny villages in the frigid cold among the border. They eked out meager returns of grain and led packs of sheep and cattle in the hills. They were shepherds and farmers.

Maximus had called upon the men of the North a handful of times and one of them was to deal with a great menace to the East that had cropped up. Ragnar dispatched fyrds of men, aided by local elders and ealdormen, to dispatch the Blackhat Menace. The Amish Wars lasted only a few months as the men of Gore-Glazic blood removed and burned the lands of the Blackhat, turning entire villages to little more than rubble and smoke. The black-hats were completely eradicated by the shepherds and peasants.

<i>"The insidious will never triumph, for their strength is that of weakness. They deceive and gird their words in flowery prose and majestic enunciation. To the simple spearfolk, their words and banter mean little as we crack their skulls open like watermelons, and cast their ichor upon the soil. Their mewls mattered little."</i>

<i>"There is no love for them left in me, for they are not my people. They have my blood, but not my faith. They crack rocks on bone and stoke weak fires and claim to be masters. They are nothing."</i>
— Saint Ragnar Odwyn

When war came once more the zealous and loyal Northlanders picked up their blades and spears, their bats and nooses and muskets. They marched at the bidding of the First Citizen, for he called for their action in slaughter. They racked the powder and gathered their arsenals, and set out on horseback and on foot. And when Maximus' set forth to lay holy waste to the Great Tree of the Gay menace, the Gore-Glazic rode out to reave the countryside. They brought war to the small places while Maximus brought the war to their heart. It is here where Ragnar would reave and set a terrible name for himself among the local Gores of what would one day be the Hill of Light. He broke their backs upon his knee, and shattered their meager warhosts with his great pressgang of shepherds and farmers. Peasants they were, they stood against the disgusting giants of the woods, and with sheer numbers they brought victory.

But not all was well. Ragnar found himself mortally wounded near the end of his campaign in the low places, and was set upon by a nameless Gay Chief. There, the Chief told him to beg for his life.

<i>"You putrid oaf... I refuse to conform to what you think you may see in me. I shall not surrender who I truly am."</i>

With the swing of a wicked axe, Ragnar's belly was split wide and he died on the field of battle. His men carried the victory, and his funeral was a vigil held for seven days and seven nights. No such great native leader of the Gore-Glaze would arise until generations later, under the purview of Saint Matheus when the Gore-Glazic people would be put to their breaking point.

<i>"We stand in one of the last remaining gardens on Gaia, a veritable Eden of proportions not unlike those of the days of the Empire. Yet long ago here, in the North, has arisen a sinister creed - one of misbegotten hatred of our people, cast upon us by savages! When the darkness descends, they will be smothered and lost - oh, Lord and Father Maximus, the great dark will not be our end. When the world falls into the end of days, we will rise again like a bright star."</i>
— Saint Matheus the Bald

In the frigid cold of the Hill of Light, there was the venerable Saint Matheus the Bald. Born Jeremiah Matheus, a man of pure Philimonjio blood amongst the North folk, he had risen through the ranks of the Low Ministry following his induction in his youth. He cleft through the heathens in the outlying villages, tidying the blemishes against the faith that had managed to find their way into the flock in the earlier years. They came during a time of collapse and sin, when pain was the commonmost, and there seemed no end and no hope.

By Matheus’ own holy hand he restored hope and prevented a great collapse, bringing strength to the Gay-Gores again. He bid them to build great walls and fortifications, and for his actions he was made High Priest.

<i>"It is cold here among the sticks and reeds. The woods are dark and filled with wicked things; yet the Hill stands defiant in the face of the end."</i>

<i>“Know sanctuary, for it is all you will find here. Know compassion, for it is all I will show you. Know peace, for it is what I promise to render unto you. Know the Light, for it is truth and glory.”</i>
—  Saint Matheus the Bald 

It is well known the hatred that Matheus had of the Gay Gore. That justified and well-harbored dislike, mistrust and disregarding nature he held against them. For they knew nothing but treachery and barbarism, pillaging the outlying villages for all they were worth. The hordes of Shagalaxian barbarians, their Chieftains unnamed and rightfully forgotten, had forced the many shepherds and hunters from their unwalled hamlets into the Hill of Light.

A burgeoning population meant many more mouths to feed and with the granaries empty, Matheus spoke on behalf of the Cardinal: “Let the lands be for us all, and the Glaze’s bounty be made so that all may partake in its hallowed splendor.” And so the hunters reaved the forests and brought back bodies of elk and bear, and fed the many hungry that dwelt within.

What few outlying hamlets still supplied grain to the Hill, paying their tithe in hundredweights of flour and barley or in bodies upon bodies of fighting men. But, even with what seemed order and peace restored, came killers with fiery hatred.

Led by a Shagalaxian King, the many native clans of Gores marched upon the few who stood.

—  Saint Matheus the Bald 

And so Matheus’ hatred was brought to bear, for he had to draw his blade and rouse the fyrds. A horde of men wreathed in bleached iron and steel, with muskets full of powder and guns full of pop-a-shot, were followed by smoke-belching iron leviathans that crunched plants and man alike under their iron treads. They came for the Hill, and all that dwelt within.

They burnt through the hamlets and the villages, and in their wake a horde of refugees found sanctuary behind high walls. They huddled and cried when the Gay-Gores came, as the hird stood defiant in the face of great destruction. They roared with voice and with horn, banging shields with swords and casting out their defamation and damnation from the top of the Walls.

All know that Matheus stood upon the ramparts, and he let loose a furious bellow.
<i>“Let not a single of them live! Let not a single one draw another breath near our home! Defend your families, shake your spears and rattle your shields! Take to the hills, and rend them apart!”</i>

And so they did, roaring out from the Hill with furious abandon. The iron treads were stalled by corpses and logs, the Shagalaxian armor was bent and broken by furious peasants, and their ammo soon fell empty as only yet more poured out from behind their great concrete walls.

While Goreic leviathans lay destroyed, their spearfolk army smashed and slain by furious peasants, there were many dead Gore-Glaze as payment. Strewn across the whole of a corpse field that would bloom into a tradition, to bury the newly dead among the original dead, to commemorate the battle that saw the Hill of Light saved.

Matheus, much like Ragnar before him, was felled in battle. Unlike Ragnar, Matheus still drew breath and the many local physicians tried their best to heal him back to health. And yet he bid them stop, and told them to bury him in the woods.

Another seven day and seven night vigil, and Matheus was laid to rest in a tomb outside of the Church he had consecrated, which now lay destroyed, his body still dwelling near.

<i>“I know the Light within you is burning dim, brother. The pain that resides within you. It saddens me to see you blinded by your suffering. I too succumb to darkness and despair.

My Lords, I scribble these notes in desperation. I cry thee for heedance in these times of treachery. I am but a humble Emissary of the Light, and I report that mine Sanctuary has fallen. It was not from Gores, no Spearfolk breached these walls. Indeed I report uprising of lowborn making.

If this note is to fall into hands of Philimonjios creed, I urge ye to copy these letters and spread them to all Southern men still breathing. Beware, beware the Great Northern Orthodoxy! Madness hath taken them, they hear not our demands of fealty. For in the frigid North they fester, blood of Gore Kin. From the woods they stalk and chant their hymns and curses. Put them to the sword, I beg ye!

It started slow, like a growing fern. From the famine that hath ensued following bad harvest, their preachings took root. Their cursed church, I believe, was deep in a flooded canal close to the town square. I heard them cry out to Sol to worsen their condition, for they begged for further sufferings. We did not see them a threat to our Ministry, they were indeed more inclined to turn their blades against themselves. That was until the man with the Golden Face made his presence known.

The Golden Faced Prophet enchanted his followers with a desire for murder and thievery. With his own words he claimed his Sol valued Gold above Blood. He stated a Great Debt of Atonement must be repaid in full, through Blood and Gold each penny and heart shall be ripped from the wealthy until Sol shines again. Then he set his wretches upon the castle, and by Glaze I still yet weep at the memory.

The Sanctuary I was sworn to protect is no more. The halls have been ransacked, the stores pillaged, and all that remains are the corpses of the fallen. The Gate has been breached, the walls brought low, and the Thralls are soon to roam the bloodied streets. I still live but only by mine own cowardice. That is why I pen these words, for as witness I at least spread truth of their deeds. This night I shall plunge a dagger deep into mine neck, for it is my duty as Emissary to execute deserters.

At the end of the Fifth Era, the Undergod entered the mortal realm, bringing forth eternal darkness.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Theory of Origins</b></font>
Long ago, hidden vestiges of the world were said to possess ancient and otherworldly tomes containing forbidden knowledge that no mortal souls were meant to comprehend - to know these secrets was to live an eternal nightmare where the mind was forever overtaken with the aggregate of existence itself. Those who returned with this knowledge were cast into the farthest confinements of catacombs and dungeons, their writings burned by scribes under orders of the very clergy they pledged affinity to. For all their rantings and despair, those who would foretell blackness beneath the fabrics of our reality were considered madmen, pronounced insane.

And yet, despite every inkling of inquisitorial censure, even the harshest of scrutiny became unwarranted in the face of a lack of knowledge - for without conception by any mortal being was a truth so unfounded and beneath determinant features of the afterlife, or even of Hell itself - lurking in the dark shadows of nonexistence, shielded from the understanding of any being of mortality or divinity alike, was a fact that would spell the undoing of everything - and so indeed, men of holy esteem ascribed earthly titles.

This new calamity was finally christened, and for decades thereafter - for the precognitive conduits amongst the Loremasters were found to suffer many gripping nightmares as the power of the catalysts were wrought upon Gaia during its infernal purification, and the maws of the Earth's mantle opened to swallow entire kingdoms and billow with the brimming monstrosities of the Begotten. The clergy, dazzled and terrified by the sudden affliction upon all of mankind, turned to their most trusted for ethereal guidance - only to find many of their archivists spiraling into frenzy. Over the course of days, these archivists would perish one by one, choking and spluttering as if suffocating on their words alone - some foaming at the mouth as horrible sickness overtook their body, their delirious minds knowing no quarter. It is said that within the grand magistrate's catacombs, one of the Empire's most composed librarians awoke from a madness-induced slumber, just as the chamber Medici had tended to his care - witnesses spoke that he had restrained the assistant Medicus to his side with great panic and frustration, any and all semblance of soul devoid in his crazed eyes. Shortly before his heart was said to give out, with a single guttural avalanche of hysteria, he warned all who would listen of the eldritch curse that had finally manifested itself beyond the slivers of happenstance, the same being that was responsible for the fall of the great empires at the hands of the Begotten - a being which he coined as being "below God Himself" - <b>“the Undergod".</b>

Since the decades that followed, the Undergod has continued to exact its sacrilegious influence upon the ruins of Hard-Glazed society - its composed silence and unfathomable nature showing no desire for tithing paid be it in commodity or iconography. From the spiraling voids and infinite blackness from which it came, the only predictable facet is its hatred for all things living, and the slow, calculated vanquishing of existence itself.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Appearance</b></font>
The rumination of the Undergod in any semblance is considered a high crime, an unforgivable blasphemy by almost every leading faith authority within the lands - for the temptations of the icon lead to deprivation and dullness of the mind. To contemplate the Undergod is to dispel one's own faith, a willing transfiguration of the self into a beacon for attack. Despite this, the last of peasant rabble had convened in secret, muttering to one another their limited conceptions of what the Undergod is.
]]

Book_Undergod_Page5 = [[
As a result of these conflicting sacrilegious accounts and texts, it is impossible to determine the true form of the Undergod - when not taking the form of clouded blots and subterranean tendrils that span for eternal intervals, the preferred anthropological icon of the Undergod is that of a newborn baby, a man, or an apparition which draws from elements of both - the informative behind this artistry is clear, as the Undergod itself has been considered a "young" deity, but to do so would be sorely mistaken, as it would suggest the passage of time as a commonality between our realm and that of the Undergod. In more dramatic portrayals, this amalgam of young and old would wear breastplate stained with the blood of slain deities, and a massive, flaming sword of purifying white light - it is said that a single swing of this sword was enough to create the great rifts within the Earth which still remain today.

Despite the detailed nature of these depictions, no mortal being has perceived the Undergod in its true form - those who would, it is believed, shall be swiftly extinguished by the cleansing of the Undergod's essence.

At the very height of power among the great empires of the Philimonjio after the final defeat of the Gay Gore, the mantles of Gaia suffered a disturbance which caught the attention of leading clergy authorities worldwide - great quakes shook the necropolises of the ancient world to their core, enormous cracks within the ground giving way and blistering with the bubbling pools of magma and brimstone which came fountaining into the atmosphere, polluting the clean air and fertile grounds in every corner of the Earth. Tranquil and serene vignettes of rummaging fauna and plant life were immediately covered in ash, blackened carbon polluting the lungs of animals and inhabitants alike. 

As the ravines deepened, ridges and canyons filled with bubbling magma soon gave way to unearthed tusks of flesh, bone, and sinew - thrashing limbs, gibbering mouths and faces were visible within, screaming in flavorful tongues of death and calamity to be wrought upon all of mankind. Onlookers hastily retreated to their great palaces and forts, those Holy men servile to their government displaying the first and only instance of true mortal terror - spilling over fine cheeses and wines, with the first inclination to backhand their servitors for their drivel, soon flushing white as the plates upon which they dined - many officials indeed resigned themselves to their chambers under guard, while the few men of Holy honor who had found themselves among the living.

Book_Begotten_Page2 = [[
The onslaught began, as apparitions incomprehensible to the very nightmares of men appeared within the villages, towns, and homes, their sulfur-slicked skin burning the ground wherever they touched - the peasant breadwinners and wives and children made easy prey to the thralls, as their final moments were punctuated by the sheer revulsion of horror which befell the most dreaded of fates. Residents were poked, punctured, and picked apart in the most unholy and inhumane ways, the thralls savoring their wails of pain and mercy until their souls were fully consumed. Millions across Hard-Glazed society were harvested and brutalized. Those who managed to seek respite in fortified areas were soon struck by the blight upon the air they breathed - the black, choking smoke and a plague that seemed to affect those men unsteady in their faith the most. Many simply gave up, cursing the Glaze in blasphemous tongues and abandoning their faith entirely - they themselves would find their bodies splintering apart and rotting, transforming into an apparition themselves. Most solutions were to kill oneself, before the thralls killed them first.

Book_Begotten_Page3 = [[
As the swarm of malevolent monstrosities barreled towards the secure gates of the inner districts, the men of honor - individuals of Holy esteem and Noble Stature - rose above their station and gave out a rallying cry for their military brethren to take up arms. For many, a life of pious servitude had to culminate in a prophetic crusade just as this - and so, war was waged on every front against the advancing demons. Musket-wielding privateers in echelon cut down thousands of the hordes, while great marvels of engineering fired cannons from secure moving pillboxes and airborne contraptions rained down fire from the sky. Warlords rejoiced, assuring their followers - these unholy beasts shed blood, and if they did so, then they could be killed just as well.

In a matter of days, these Lords would find themselves and their families cornered in their fortress chambers, surrounded by the manifestation of beings, forced to watch as their innards were slowly torn apart from one another and expressed upon the marble walls as sacraments to a new faith. For all too late the lesson was learned - no one escapes the Begotten.

Begotten, despite being fairly common in the apocalyptic days, are now few and far between. Hard-Glaze interpreters have determined that many Begotten thralls have migrated in accordance with creeds passed directly upon them from their master, the Child God - the new frontier of Begotten consumption is the Hell of Satan, in the efforts of the Undergod to usurp and reign dominion of the inferno.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Physiology & Behavior </b></font>
Begotten demons come in many forms, however, the most common warring variant takes the appearance of shambling, rotting carcasses of men - these apparitions are deceptive in their territorialism, for they are capable of pursuing their prey for days on end with an almost insatiable bloodlust, without a need for rest or sustenance. Although Begotten thralls are aptly capable of using their hands or claws to pry apart their victims, many have been reported to use weaponry devised by Man, such as knives, hammers, cleavers, and even diesel-fueled chainsaws - these strange bastardizations of technology are inscribed with unholy runes which singe to the touch, imbuing these weapons with hexing properties which dramatically escalate the pain, blood loss, and healing process of even the smallest of wounds inflicted by them.

It is universally understood that Begotten thralls pose an astronomical threat, even when travelling in numbers - their persistence, lack of inhibition, and hardiness make them a reckoning to contend with.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Power from Despair</b></font>
Begotten do not require worship to sustain their unholy power. Rather, it is said that they thrive on the lack of worship, the very fabric of despair sustaining their lifeblood. Only the foolish would attempt to give any Begotten thrall payment, in credence or penance alike - those who do so would invariably find themselves victims of the next harvest.

Individuals who find themselves of already waning faith are susceptible to otherworldly plagues and diseases wrought upon by the great rending of Gaia - spore clusters sprung from the most elusive corners of Earth's mantle take root within the bodies of men and begin the utmost deterioration of the individual, resulting in an exponentially painful demise. Those who abandon their faith entirely, turning their backs on the power of the Glaze, will invariably undergo a twisted transformation as their bodies distort and splinter, any semblance of humanity and holiness expunged from their mortal coils as the dullness of pure bloodlust and misanthropy overtakes their minds, becoming yet another thrall subservient to the Undergod's every whim.

When Begotten complete the conquest of all human life in a particular area, the thralls will manifest primitive stone structures which can tower hundreds of meters in height - these pillars seem to spur the emergence of more thralls from deep below the Earth. The structures, aptly named "Pillars of Creation" by Holy authorities, appear quickly and with no discernable method behind their construction. Many have theorized that destruction of these pillars could slow or halt the incursion of Begotten thralls, however, no demolition attempts have been successful on account of the massive resources necessary to perform such an undertaking. Still, the pillars remain looming over the wasteland, a solemn and foreboding reminder of Begotten dominion over these lands.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>The First Inquisition</b></font>
<i>"Silence!"</i> boomed the Lord's thunderous voice. Silence overcame the courtroom. <i>"Enemies of the Glaze, quake and shiver. You will be found, you will face my judgement."</i>
-Lord Maximus in the First Era addressing the Black-Hat threat.

The very first Inquisition was formed shortly after the events of the Holy Hierarchy Wars in the First Era. The ruling class, the Hard-Glazed Phillimonjios, found their newly formed Empire in utter ruin, as a result of their holy wars. The common rabble did not recognize the authority of their new lords, as instead they partook in anarchistic mayhem to stay alive in the battle-torn lands. Even though the new Holy Hierarchy was bleeding, it did not have any true enemies remaining. To the West, the filthy tribes were scattered and destroyed. In the East, the squabbling darkhides warred over one another for resources, and in the North there was nothing but tales of crazed old men in the woods calling themselves Blade Druids. All that remained were the threats within.

For the first time in the history, the very first calling of nobility was sent out to all across the known Hierarchy. Every man of power, from business people to wealthy families, to military generals and most importantly the keepers of the Faith, all came to partake in the first Royal Senate. The weak minded fools were put in their place, while the strong and influential would come to cement their power for an entire generation to come. These men would become the first of the Glazic Noble Stature, but even with their great power they surely hungered for more. The nobility elected their First Citizen, the glorious Lord Maximus - an easy choice, there was no doubt to it. He would be the one to call forth arms against any who threaten the Glaze, even those within it.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>The Enemy Within</b></font>
A few decades have passed since the first Royal Senate hearing, and the Holy Hierarchy had finally managed to take firm control of the Hard-Glazed system. Indeed, the commoners were put in their place, the rabble quieted, the tribals put to slave labor, and a new Church was erected in the light of holy Glaze in the seat of District 1. Yet the Holy Hierarchy's first true test of their power was soon upon them. Trouble was brewing at court, with many noble houses voicing their distaste of the Phillimonjios hoarding all the true power to themselves. They thought nothing of it at first, petty drama from envious men surely - until members of the Phillimonjios household began to go missing, one by one. Blaming it upon the rival houses, the Phillimonjios started hiring killers to slit the throats of their perceived enemies as retaliation. The other houses would have none of it, for in truth they were not the ones responsible for the abductions. Calling forth their appointed Minsters armies, blood once again was spilled in the Holy Hierarchy.

The scholars made sure to note in great detail Lord Maximus' ferocious and authoritarian swagger as he marched into the halls of the Royal Senate. With his booming voice he silenced the room, calling forth the three top lords of the Phillimonjios family. With one single swing of his mighty blade, he cleaved off all three of their heads, letting their lifeless bodies slump to the floor in tremendous synchronization. The court room was in shock, but Lord Maximus remained still in his resolve. He pointed to the three bodies, exposing them of their black blood that oozed from their torn necks. Indeed, a great heresy was upon the Holy Hierarchy. The mutant scourge that would later be known as the Black-Hats have infiltrated the Royal Senate, by wearing the skins of the noble stature - walking in their flesh as horrific puppeteers, seeking to bring down an Empire from within.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Rise and Fall of the Holy Inquisition</b></font>
Lord Maximus selected the most trusted of his advisers to organize the creation of the Holy Inquisition. Vance Heimann the First was a man of practicality. While any ordinary Minister would simply pick the strongest of his army, Vance instead looked to the common folk, seeking honest men over brutish warriors. He selected a band of simple hunters from a large forest, those who rely upon their skills of tracking and killing in order to stay alive. It did not take long for them to be trained for the part, as many of these men had already faced many vile witches of the great woods, who preyed upon men such as them for sacrifice. The true struggle was teaching these men the complexities of court, a vital skill that they would never truly grasp, which later led to their downfall. They were given their arms, their books of law, and were finally set out upon the Royal Senate, their new hunting grounds.
]]

Book_FirstInquisition_Page4 = [[
It only took a single month for the remainder of the Black-Hats to be sought out and defeated. Whispers here, a bribe of coin there, and a trail of footprints that led to a guilty fool. The first of the Black-Hat infiltrators were easy to discover, for all it took was a simple cut from a dagger to reveal their black blood for all to see. The deception grew deeper when the Black-Hats hid their true colors through witchcraft. This only increased the Inquisition's power, as they were now allowed to carry out accusations on even red blooded men. Many were accused, and all were executed, guilty or not. Any forces of retaliation that they cooked up from their ranks of mutant men were firmly smited by Lord Maximus and his holy army. The home village of the Black-Hats were uncovered through various means of interrogation, and before the armies could arrive to give these mutant freaks a worthy genocide, they came to discover that the last of their kind had all killed themselves in a mass suicide in the village square. The Inquisition had succeeded in their task tenfold, marking the complete extinction of the Black-Hat scourge.

Too much duty and dedication can sometimes be a bad thing, as the Inquisition would soon discover. Indeed they succeeded in their task, destroying the greatest threat to the Holy Hierarchy thus far, but now they looked further within. At first they tolerated their snooping, until they began exposing men of Faith. Every single branch by which the Hierarchy was governed were facing equal, unrestrained political assassinations, with no motivation other than the various Inquisitor's sense of duty. Lord Maximus had no other option than to officially disband the Holy Inquisition, returning the men to their forest where they would live out their remaining life as simple hunters. Of course, the offended nobility would later send out hired helpers to retrieve these honest men, sending the former Inquisitors to their personal torture rooms where they would never leave. Although the Inquisition was now gone, their work would not go unnoticed by the few faithful nobility who watched as the Royal Senate's corrupt ways were exposed for all to see. Vance Heimann and his legacy would later cause the destruction of the Royal Senate, birthing the Small Council in its place.

It started when the sky screamed. The air went thick, and the sun turned black as pitch. Then the flashes began, like lightning, and the sounds that came with them… sounds that made my ears bleed. I remember stumbling into the village square, stunned and confused, the others there too, all staring at the big box they brought in years ago—the one that showed moving pictures.

It turned itself on. No one touched it. And on the screen… God.

I knew it was Him. His body was twisted, bloated like a corpse pulled from a swamp. His eyes were endless pits, staring through me, through all of us. Then He started.

He took His own hands and ripped Himself open like a sack of grain, spilling His guts—ropes of them—onto the floor. Blood, black and shining like oil, fountained out of Him, spraying across the screen. It didn’t stop. It couldn’t stop. He clawed deeper, tearing at Himself, pulling chunks of meat and bone free like He was digging for something. The sound of it—wet, ripping, snapping.

Some fell to their knees, screaming and clawing at their faces. Others laughed like lunatics and started tearing at each other, biting, scratching. And me?

That’s when it began.

They came. Monsters, things born of nightmares, crawling out of the shadows and the ground itself. They didn’t just kill. They twisted people, turned them into more of their kind. I saw Father Corbin dragged screaming from the church, his skin peeling back as he was torn into something… something that shouldn’t exist. The children too, their small bodies cracked and remade into horrors.

The flashes keep coming, lighting up the night. Each time, you hear the screaming again. Sometimes I see Him, see the moment it all went wrong. I feel His despair, His terror. And then there’s the whispers—God’s voice, worming into your head. Promises, lies, truths.

We’re all cursed now. There’s no hope. No Heaven. No salvation.

If you’re reading this, throw it in the fire. Or maybe stab yourself in the heart, before the Begotten find you. It’s better that way.

Vance Heimann the First (b. 1E d. 2E) was not born to wealth, power, or privilege. His origins were humble, and his life before the Holy Hierarchy's rise was spent as a simple hunter in the vast and treacherous forests of what became the county districts. The dense woods teemed with predators and Vance became known for his keen instincts, practical cunning, and unmatched skill in tracking.

In those years, Heimann and his fellow hunters often clashed with the strange, reclusive witches who inhabited the darkest corners of the woods. These malevolent figures, known to lure men to their doom, forced Heimann and his group to develop both physical prowess and a deep mistrust of the arcane. His triumphs over these woodland foes laid the foundation for his future as the first Grand Inquisitor.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Call to Service: Formation of the First Inquisition</b></font>
When Lord Maximus sought to eradicate the Black-Hat scourge, he turned to Heimann, whose reputation as a pragmatic, incorruptible man preceded him. While other ministers might have sought to build the Inquisition from the ranks of soldiers or nobles, Heimann broke tradition by assembling his order from men of his own peasant hunters.

These men, accustomed to the perils of stalking prey and surviving in harsh conditions, were uniquely suited for the task at hand. They were practical, efficient, and above all, untainted by the intrigue of court life. Heimann’s vision was simple: the Inquisition would be an instrument of justice, guided not by greed or ambition, but by duty to the Holy Hierarchy.

The early days of the Inquisition were marked by swift victories. Armed with steel, wit, and the holy texts outlining the laws of Glaze, Heimann’s hunters-turned-Inquisitors hunted down Black-Hats with brutal efficiency. They developed methods of interrogation that blended Heimann’s practical cunning with an almost fanatical zeal. A simple cut of the blade was often enough to reveal the black blood of the mutant infiltrators, and from there, it was a matter of following the trail of corruption to its source.

Under Heimann’s leadership, the Inquisition purged the Holy Hierarchy of its most immediate threat. The Black-Hats, those vile puppeteers who wore the flesh of nobles to infiltrate the very heart of the Royal Senate, were eradicated in record time. Heimann’s Inquisition uncovered their hidden villages, their covert gatherings, and their twisted schemes, driving the mutants to extinction.

The Inquisition’s success brought a brief era of security to the Holy Hierarchy. Yet, it was not without its costs. The Inquisition’s growing power and zeal began to spill beyond its original purpose. No longer content with rooting out the Black-Hats, Heimann’s hunters turned their gaze inward, exposing corruption and sin among the very nobility they were sworn to protect. Ministers, generals, and even priests fell under their scrutiny, and accusations of heresy flew like spent powder cartridges in the Senate halls.

Though Heimann’s dedication to justice was unwavering, it became his undoing. The nobility, increasingly threatened by the Inquisition’s relentless investigations, turned against Heimann and his men. What began as whispers of discontent soon evolved into a coordinated effort to dismantle the Inquisition.

Faced with mounting pressure, Lord Maximus, once Heimann’s staunchest supporter, made the difficult decision to disband the Inquisition. The hunters were sent back to their forests, stripped of their titles and authority. Heimann himself retired quietly, returning to the life of a simple man. But the nobility, their pride wounded and their secrets exposed, could not let the matter rest. Hired assassins were dispatched to ensure that the former Inquisitors—and Heimann himself—would never again threaten the delicate balance of power within the Holy Hierarchy.

Though Heimann’s life ended in obscurity, his legacy endured. The Inquisition’s work had exposed the rot within the Royal Senate, planting seeds of dissent that would later blossom into full rebellion. The Small Council, which replaced the corrupt Senate at the end of the Third Era, was in many ways a testament to Heimann’s ideals of accountability and justice.

Vance Heimann the First is remembered as a man of principle, whose uncompromising dedication to duty changed the course of the Holy Hierarchy. Though his methods were brutal and his end tragic, his name remains a symbol of incorruptibility.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Discovery of the Gore</b></font>

Dating back to the dawn of the First Era, the ‘Gay Gores’ started off in a shroud of mystery. Originally thought to be a mad cult of northern folk, the Glazic nobility paid them little attention. Early serfs would report to their local Minister about 'mad mountain-men and spearfolk, white of skin' who would watch their villages at a distance. Rumors would spread among the County Districts which bordered between the Gore and Glaze.

It was not until the Second Era, in the aftermath of the Hierarchy wars, that the Royal Senate heard word of the Goreic Kingdom. It was said that a local county district's tradition was to send their village elders to the north, so that they would become one with the snow. For years they would send their elders into the cold winds of the north, and none would return. This changed when an elder returned from their quest with a 'ghastly look,' and a word of their findings in the Northlands. His findings were immediately reported to the Royal Senate, detailing a face-to-face meeting with these men, who called themselves 'the Gores' and spoke of false gods that were of anti-Glazic intent.

<i>"I suppose It'd be quite requisitory of the Royal Senate to enact a burdening response to these recent attacks on our peasant friends. To sit back, wait, and hope for a digression? Simply put, these Spearfolk must be swiftly cut down before they grow in number."</i>
—V.K Heimann - the 'Steel Tongue' of his days.

Around the early phase of the Second Era, beginning with the first encounter of the Gores at the Gay King Summit, Goreic raids have grown from legendary to quite common and then annoyingly frequent. From ambassador intelligence to captured Spearfolk, it was apparent that a great number of Goreic men were actually once of Glazic faith, and have converted over. Life among these people is extremely simple, their day consisting of crawling around in dark underground tunnels, or in cold villages on the mountains. Strangely, when asked what these men believe in, each response will vary. 

According to the beliefs of the Gores, a great set of deities rule over the world, known as the 'Family.' This family, consisting of two brothers, a sister, a mother, and a father, had created the world by 'finding the way.' The names of these deities never seem to be agreed on, but their roles seem unanimously known. The mother is the caretaker, the voice of reason. The father is the hunter, the seeker of nourishment for the family, but without the other members of the family to support him, he is nothing. The first brother is intelligent, but lacks communion. The second brother is of great communion, but lacks intelligence. The sister is the trickster, who causes troubles for the family, but will also help the family in time of need.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>History & Origins</b></font>
Unlike the other Holy Orders, the Knights of Sol are entirely new, having no history from times before. Of course, there have always been Anointed Knights within the Holy Hierarchy, but such a role was mostly regarded as a status symbol of sorts. The legend of the Knights of Sol began as any Glazic tale of triumph does, when the Light comes to meet darkness in its strongest hour. When Skylight ascended to abandon the Earth, those who remained witnessed an unholy battle. One by one the Ministers in charge of their sanctuaries of Light found themselves alone. Those preparing themselves for the mass suicides were cut short by the horrifying sight of Skylight falling to the Earth, a blazing inferno. Now it was truly hopeless, the last promise of a future for mankind was surely gone. The Undergod had succeeded in its task to purify the world of Man and its sin. When the foundations of the church quaked and cracked, and the Gatekeepers ran low on munitions for their muskets, suffering was soon upon the last defenders. Then they saw it, a crack emerged from the hellish sky to reveal a golden ray of Light, something that none had ever seen before in their short lives. Seventeen men stood tall in the horizon, wearing glorious white armor, wielding swords glowing bright. Demons fell upon them, but these Seventeen hacked and sliced a path through them. Thousands fell by their blade before the demons retreated into the darkness, and it seemed that humanity would live for at least another day.

It has been many, many years since that dark day and now the Seventeen no longer walk this Earth. They may be gone, but their legacy stands tall. A surviving Minister in the county district sanctuary had created a new Greater Order, the Knights of Sol, in honor of the Glorious Seventeen. These Knights may never be as powerful as them, though they will mold themselves in their image, choosing to lock away petty needs and desires of man for a purely zealous and dutiful lifestyle. The rigorous process of becoming a Knight is one of the reasons that the order is so uncorrupted. One must first become recognized by their Lord, often by surviving the ranks of the Gatekeepers, an achievement only one in a hundred could boast. Then they must complete a task requiring absolute bravery, and enormous luck only the Glaze could provide. Even when they are given the opportunity to drink from the holy waters, they risk being 'purified' through flame, often turning their innards into ash, killing them on the spot. Having great skill and ambitions is not enough for one to become a Knight of Sol, instead they must truly be someone favored by the Light.
]]

Book_Seventeen_Page2 = [[
While the Knights of Sol may seem like perfect men, it is not often the truth. Many who have finally been accepted into the Knights of Sol will be consumed by prayer, choosing to live out the rest of their lives kneeling before an altar, most even collapsing from starvation before one. Other Knights may turn to sin as they have been consumed by their own ego, seeing themselves as gods for they have completed an impossible task. These Knights will later feel an inferno obliterating their bellies after drinking from the holy waters in their daily ritual. As a Knight of Sol, if you have mere fleeting thoughts of corruption and sin, it may lead to your instant death following the daily purification ritual. As such, the Knights of Sol holds its name as the most pure order within the Holy Hierarchy.

The duties of a Knight are to serve the Holy Hierarchy without question, and to follow the Chivalric Code of the Seventeen. Following the unholy conquest, there are many territories belonging to the Hierarchy that have no living Lords to hold them. Knights are encouraged to rally up mobs of Gatekeepers or commoners to reclaim these lost territories, holding them until a capable Minister can step forth to claim them as their own.

Knights are given the absolute best equipment available in the royal armories. Despite this, Knights are never seen with muskets or any other sort of firearm. Guns are not forbidden by the order, but to use one would be seen as stooping to the level of a dirty common man. Knights forge their own swords, tempering the molten blade in holy water and praying every step of the way. They may also wear plate armor, although some Knights prefer to fight in their robes as warrior priests. When the situation calls for the use of firearms, a Knight may assign themselves a Squire from the ranks of the Gatekeepers, giving them a list of duties in return for privileges, such as training.
